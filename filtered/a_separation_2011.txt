TITLES
A document is on the glass inside a copier. The copier
starts copying, a light moves from one side of the copier
to the other and a copy is made of an ID card. A hand
removes one ID card and places another its place. The hand
places the ID cards of various individuals – men, women,
young, middle aged and old – on the glass plate of the
copier and copies them. The titles appear and fade out on
this scene.
INT. FAMILY COURT – COURTROOM – DAY
In a branch of the Iranian Divorce Court, SIMIN and NADER
are seated across from the judge. The door to the room is
open and from the room next door, the voices of people
waiting to see the judge and the commotion of the corridors
is heard. Nader is quiet and pensive and staring at the
judge. Simin speaks continuously.
JUDGE (O.S.)
Madame, the things you are
saying are not reasons with
which you can file for a
divorce, unless there is
something else.
SIMIN
Like what?
JUDGE (O.S.)
Like if he is an addict,
physically abuses you or does
not give you an allowance.
SIMIN
No, he is not an addict. On the
contrary, he is a good, decent
person…
JUDGE (O.S.)
Then why do you want a divorce?
2
SIMIN
Because he won't come with me.
If he does I'll drop my case
for a divorce…
(to Nader)
Will you come?
NADER
No, I won’t. If it’s important
for her to leave, she can.
SIMIN
Your honor, ask him why he
won’t, why he doesn’t want to
come?
NADER
(to Simin)
You know why.
SIMIN
No I don’t.
NADER
(to the Judge)
Let her give me one reason to
convince me why we should move
abroad in these circumstances.
SIMIN
You give me one reason why we
should stay.
NADER
(to Simin)
I’ll give you a thousand. The
first one is I can’t leave my
father.
SIMIN
But you can leave your wife?
NADER
You brought me here! You filed
for a divorce! When did I leave
you?!
SIMIN
3
Didn’t you just say she can
leave if she wants to?
NADER
Yes and I’ll say it again. When
you don't want to live with me…
I didn’t get you by force and
I’m not going to keep you by
force… One day you came to live
with me. Today you don’t want
to.
SIMIN
Your honor, his excuse is his
father’s illness… His father
has Alzheimer’s. He doesn’t
even know that his son is
around.
NADER
You think he doesn’t know.
SIMIN
Does he?
NADER
Yes I feel that he does.
SIMIN
It makes no difference to him,
whether it is you that is with
him or a stranger. He doesn’t
even know that you are his son.
NADER
But I know that he is my dad.
SIMIN
Doesn’t your daughter’s future
matter to you?
JUDGE (O.S.)
(to Simin)
So all the children living in
this country don’t have a
future?
SIMIN
4
As a mother I prefer that she
not grow up in these
circumstances. Can I have this
right as a mother?
JUDGE (O.S.)
What circumstances?
Simin falls silent.
JUDGE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Is your child better off here
with both her parents or there
without a father?
SIMIN
That’s why I am insisting that
he also come with us.
NADER
I am not in a position to
leave.
There’s a brief silence between Nader and Simin who do not
even look at each other.
SIMIN
(to the Judge)
What should we do now?
JUDGE (O.S.)
Nothing. Go back to your lives. (cid:2)
(cid:2) (cid:2)
SIMIN
If we could, I wouldn’t file
for a divorce.
JUDGE (O.S.)
You can have a divorce only if
he agrees to grant you one.(cid:2)
SIMIN
He just said that he agrees.
(to Nader)
Didn’t you say you agree to a
divorce?
JUDGE (O.S.)
5
(to Nader)
Are you willing to grant her a
divorce?(cid:2)
NADER
If she prefers going abroad to
live to her husband and child,
then I have no objection to a
divorce.
SIMIN
(to Nader)
What does “you prefer” mean?
(to the Judge)
Your honor please look at these
documents.
Simin shows the paperwork she is holding to the judge.
SIMIN
Your honor after 18 months of
running around and expenses, we
got our residency. It has been
six months now and it will
expire in 40 days. Why should
we…
JUDGE (O.S.)
Like I said, this is your
personal problem. For a
divorce, you need his consent. (cid:2)
SIMIN
If he consents to a divorce,
what happens to my daughter?
JUDGE (O.S.)
You have to agree on
everything. How old is your
daughter?
SIMIN
She’ll be eleven in two weeks.
JUDGE (O.S.)
She can only come with you if
(MORE)
6
her father gives his
permission. If he doesn’t then
she can’t leave.
SIMIN
He won’t give his permission.
He knows I will not leave
without my daughter.
JUDGE (O.S.)
That’s between you two. Good
day.
Nader rises from his seat.
SIMIN
Your honor, I have to know
where I stand before these 40
days are up.
JUDGE (O.S.)
(to Nader)
Please sign here.
Nader approaches the judge’s desk to sign the documents.
(cid:2) (cid:2)
SIMIN
I’ll give up everything if only
he’ll give me my daughter.
NADER
Our daughter is attached to me.
She doesn’t even want to go
with you.
SIMIN
She doesn’t know better.
NADER
Why not? She is eleven years
old.
SIMIN
Your honor, please. Can’t you
help me?
JUDGE (O.S.)
(to Simin)
7
Please sign here and don't
waste the court's time.
SIMIN
What do you mean waste?
JUDGE (O.S.)
You can’t come here for every
little problem that you have.
SIMIN
It’s a little problem to you.
JUDGE (O.S.)
Yes, I am the judge here and
your problem is not a problem…
ma’am sign here.
Unwillingly, Simin signs the court documents.
INT. CORRIDORS AND STAIRWAYS – DAY
Simin moves through the stairways and corridors of the
courthouse among the throngs of men and women walking
between the various offices or waiting for their turn.
Nader walks behind her.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – STAIRWAY – DAY
Two middle-aged movers are carrying an old piano down the
stairs from the second floor. Simin is coming up the stairs
holding a suitcase and waits on the landing for the movers
to bring down the piano and clear the way for her to enter
Nader’s house.
MOVER #1
(holding the
piano)
Lady, you said the first floor.
SIMIN
This is the first floor…
MOVER #1
So what’s the floor beneath us?
SIMIN
8
That’s the ground floor, this
is the first…
MOVER #1
The price we gave was for one
floor.
SIMIN
Isn’t the buyer paying you for
the move?
MOVER #1
Only for one floor…
SIMIN
I don’t understand what you are
saying!
The movers put the piano down on the floor.
MOVER #1
Then call the buyer. He has to
tell us what to do. This is two
floors.
SIMIN
(frustrated)
Fine, clear the way, I’ll pay
for one floor…
The workers pick the piano up to carry it downstairs.
EXT. BALCONY – DAY
Nader is in the balcony, his old father, MR. MORTEZA, is
seated on a chair. Nader is using an electric shaver to
shave his father’s beard. They are seen from between an
open door to the balcony.
INT. HALLWAY – DAY
Nader’s apartment is a relatively large and old apartment.
It is a little cluttered. In a corner of the hallway RAZIEH
is seated on a chair waiting. Her little daughter SOMAYEH
is leaning against her knee. Through the opening of the
door, Somayeh watches Nader shaving his father’s beard.
Nader and his father are talking but because of the
(CONTINUED)
9
distance, their voices can’t be heard. Simin enters as she
shakes the dust off her suitcase. On her way to the
bedroom, she passes Razieh and Somayeh, who are waiting.
INT. BEDROOM – DAY
Simin’s clothing and other personal things are in a pile on
the bed. She stuffs them into her suitcase.
RAZIEH (O.S.)
Excuse me madam…
Simin leaves the suitcase and walks out of the room.
INT. HALLWAY AND TERMEH’S ROOM – DAY
Termeh pretends to be busy with her homework, even though
it is clear she is not concentrating. Simin enters.
SIMIN
Go tell your dad they want to
leave.
TERMEH
Why don’t you tell him?
Simin shoots Termeh an angry glance.
TERMEH
What?
SIMIN
(quietly)
Didn’t we agree?
TERMEH
I’m studying.
Termeh leaves the room. Simin climbs a chair to reach the
shelves in the closet and get her things. Simin throws all
her books, magazines and notes out of the closet. Suddenly
she stops, quietly climbs down the chair and from between
the window blinds looks at Nader in the hallway where he is
taking his father Mr. Morteza to his room. Termeh says
something to her dad.
INT. MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM, THE KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM – DAY
10
Simin places her books on the dining table next to the rest
of her things. Razieh is standing and speaking to Nader who
is carrying the dirty laundry from his father’s room to the
kitchen. Nader’s father is sitting on the edge of his bed
and is looking out of his room and talking gibberish.
Somayeh is watching him curiously. Simin pretends to be
busy with her luggage but is in fact listening in on Nader
and Razieh’s conversation.
NADER
…You have to give him his
medication on time, keep him
away from the stove, from
leaving the house cause he'll
get lost, from going to the
window.
(louder to Termeh)
Termeh get your laundry.
Nader loads the clothes into the washing machine. From the
stairway, the mover calls Simin.
MOVER #1
Madam?
SIMIN
Come upstairs…
NADER
I have to be at work at 7:30.
You have to be here before that
so that I can leave him with
you.
RAZIEH
That’s too early. I’d have to
leave my house at 5:30.
NADER
Can you make it by 8? He wakes
up at 8:30. If you ring the
upstairs neighbor’s bell,
they’ll let you in. I ‘ll leave
you the apartment key above the
door.
Nader goes from the kitchen to the living room. He pays no
(CONTINUED)
11
attention to Simin. Meanwhile Simin takes her purse and
several music instruction notebooks, which are next to
where the piano used to be, and walks towards the mover who
has by now reached the door.
RAZIEH
Excuse me… what’s the pay per
month?
NADER
300,000.
SIMIN
(to the mover)
Here, give these to him. They
are music instruction
notebooks. They might be of
use.
Simin gives the mover a 50,000 toman note.
MOVER #1
I don’t have any change.
RAZIEH
(to Nader)
300,000 is a little… it’s too
little.
NADER
No, that’s the rate. Ask
around.
Simin goes to the bedroom to get some change. Termeh walks
towards the kitchen with her laundry. Razieh is still
thinking.
RAZIEH
The commute is far. Several bus
lines.
NADER
(to Termeh)
Press the button. I already put
the powder in…
(to Razieh)
It's all I can afford. So…
12
RAZIEH
Let me think about it and let
you know.
NADER
Then let me know by this
afternoon. I’ve interviewed
someone else, if you are not
interested I don’t want to lose
that person.
INT. BEDROOM – DAY
Simin is counting money she has taken from the vanity table
drawer. She loses count, gets frustrated and starts
counting again.
RAZIEH (O.S.)
Goodbye ma’am.
Simin places the rest of the cash back in the drawer where
some money is kept.
INT. STAIRWAY – DAY
Razieh and her daughter go down the stairs. Simin pays the
mover. The mover thanks her and leaves. Simin goes back
inside the apartment.
INT. KITCHEN – DAY
Termeh and Nader are bending over the washing machine and
trying to figure out the settings.
NADER
Which setting does she usually
use?
TERMEH
Should I go ask her?
NADER
She hasn’t left yet, and
already you want to make me
look bad?!... Look I say we put
it on… which one do you think?
TERMEH
13
I say four.
NADER
Why four?
TERMEH
Cause the button has faded.
See? She must’ve used it the
most.
Nader proudly looks at Termeh and puts the setting on 4 and
turns the machine on.
NADER
Four it is. From now on we’ll
set everything in this house on
the faded settings.
TERMEH
(worried)
She is really leaving.
NADER
She’ll be back.
INT. LIVING ROOM AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM – DAY
Simin takes a CD from the pile next to the stereo on the
shelf beneath the television. Nader walks out of the
kitchen over to the living room and pretends to be
interested in the channels he is switching back and forth
to with the TV remote control. Simin places her suitcase by
the door. Mr. Morteza realizes that she is leaving.
MR. MORTEZA
Simin where’re you going?
SIMIN
I’ll be right back.
MR. MORTEZA
Where’re you going?
With no other choice, Simin goes into Mr. Morteza’s room.
SIMIN
Just to the corner. I’ll be
right back.
14
With his trembling hand, Mr. Morteza holds Simin’s and
keeps her from leaving.
SIMIN
I’ll be right back… let me go.
MR. MORTEZA
Where are you going?
SIMIN
Dad I told you… I’ll come back.
Mr. Morteza is staring blankly at Simin and does not let go
of her hand.
SIMIN
Termeh! Come stay with your
grandfather.
Nader comes to his father’s room.
NADER
Dad get up… Get up. I want to
take you to the bathroom.
Nader holds his father under his arms and tries to free
Simin’s hand free from his hold.
NADER
Let go of her hand… Dad… let
go.
MR. MORTEZA
Where are you taking me?
NADER
To the bathroom and then we’ll
go and buy the paper… come on…
(to Simin)
You can leave.
MR. MORTEZA
Simin.
NADER
She’ll be back.
15
Nader separates Simin’s hand from his father’s and takes
him to the bathroom. Simin tries to conceal her emotions
and sadness from Nader.
INT. TERMEH’S ROOM – DAY
Simin takes the remaining pile of books from Termeh’s desk.
Termeh walks to the door.
SIMIN
You’re not coming?
Termeh does not respond. Simin realizes that Termeh is
stressed.
TERMEH
Why are you taking your books?
SIMIN
I want them.
TERMEH
All this for just 2 weeks?
Simin closes the door to keep their voices from being
heard.
SIMIN
You promised not to say
anything to him.
TERMEH
And you promised it would only
be for 2 weeks.
Uncertain of the promise she’s made, Simin looks at Termeh.
INT. TERMEH’S ROOM AND HALLWAY – DAY
Nader is standing in front of the half-open bathroom door
and waiting for his father to come out.
NADER
(to his father)
Don’t put your hand there.
16
Simin walks out of Termeh’s room to the hallway. She is
holding the CD she has found. Perhaps it is an excuse to
say goodbye.
SIMIN
(regarding the CD)
I’m taking this Shajarian.
NADER
Take it, take whichever you
want.
SIMIN
No just this one… goodbye.
NADER
Goodbye.
Simin gathers her things to leave. Nader is thinking.
Termeh watches her mother leave from between the shades of
her room.
INT. SIMIN’S CAR – EXT. STREET – DAY
Simin is behind the wheel and turns into a main road from a
side street. She has on a pair of sunglasses. Her face does
not show the signs of distress until her tears flow from
under her sunglasses. On the other side of the street she
sees Razieh and her daughter walking on the sidewalk. She
stops a little further up the street and honks her horn to
catch their attention.
INT. SIMIN’S CAR – EXT. STREET – DAY
Razieh and her daughter are sitting on the back seat of
Simin’s car next to Simin’s luggage and belongings. Simin
is driving.
RAZIEH
I thought you live here.
SIMIN
No I've recently moved to my
mom’s.
RAZIEH
This will be a little difficult
for me.
17
SIMIN
Don’t worry. He is a decent and
honorable man. I trust him
completely.
Razieh is a little skeptical. She doesn’t know what
decision to make.
SIMIN
Besides he has already left the
house when you get there and
you leave when he comes home.
You’ll bring your daughter and
Termeh won’t be alone. They’ll
keep each other company and
this way I’ll feel better.
Razieh thinks a little about this.
SIMIN
Tell your sister-in-law what
you decide and I’ll call and
ask her.
RAZIEH
OKAY.
EXT. BUS TERMINAL – DAY
The terminal is crowded and full of traffic. Razieh and her
daughter make their way towards the bus stop and wait with
all the passengers for the bus to arrive.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE NADER’S HOUSE – DAY
It is early in the next morning and Razieh and Somayeh are
quickly walking up Nader’s street. They reach Nader’s
building. Razieh rings the doorbell. The door is buzzed
open.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – STAIRWAY – DAY
The sound of a door opening is heard and Razieh and Somayeh
come up the stairs. Razieh comes up the stairs with some
difficulty. Razieh reaches up and searches the ledge above
the door. She finds the key and opens the door. She goes in
with Somayeh.
18
INT. LIVING ROOM AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM – DAY
Razieh locks the door from the inside. She places her bag
and her chador on the sofa. Curious, Somayeh stares at Mr.
Morteza from the doorway. He is sleeping on the bed and has
an oxygen mask covering his nose and mouth.
SOMAYEH
What’s this?
RAZIEH
SHH!
SOMAYEH
(in a lower voice)
What’s this?
RAZIEH
It’s oxygen… move away. You’ll
wake him!
Curious, Somayeh is still standing in the doorway and
Razieh goes into the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM – DAY
Razieh clears the breakfast table and places the dishes in
the sink. From the leftover bread and cheese on the table,
she prepares a basic breakfast for her daughter. Somayeh
walks into the kitchen.
SOMAYEH
(quietly and
whispering)
Is he dead?
RAZIEH
(quietly)
No… take this over there and
eat.
SOMAYEH
So why doesn’t he move?
RAZIEH
Cause he’s asleep.
19
Somayeh takes the tray and walks out of the kitchen. Razieh
takes the load of dishes from the sink and places them in
the washing machine. She tries to not make any noise. She
doesn’t want to wake Mr. Morteza. It is clear that she is
not very familiar with working with a dishwasher. As she is
bending over and placing a dish in the washing machine, she
suddenly stops and feels something.
RAZIEH
(quietly)
Somayeh… come quick… run.
She motions to Somayeh to come. Somayeh places the tray on
the sofa and hurries to the kitchen. Razieh is calm and
stands and places her hand on the side of her belly. She
feels something beneath her hand and shows her pleasure to
Somayeh with a smile. Somayeh enthusiastically places her
ear on her mother’s belly.
RAZIEH
This side.
Somayeh moves her ear around on her mother’s protruding
belly to better feel the fetus’s movements. She doesn’t
feel anything.
SOMAYEH
I don’t hear anything!
RAZIEH
Shhh!
SOMAYEH
What is it doing?
RAZIEH
It’s woken up.
Somayeh now feels her mother’s belly with her hand. She
tries to find the baby’s movements.
RAZIEH
It’s naughty.
Now Razieh notices the hallway where Mr. Morteza is walking
towards the house door. She walks towards him.
20
RAZIEH
Hello.
INT. HALLWAY AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM – DAY
Razieh walks towards Mr. Morteza who has reached the house
door and wants to leave the house. From the kitchen doorway
Somayeh looks curiously at Mr. Morteza and is a little
scared.
RAZIEH
Where do you want to go?
MR. MORTEZA
I want… to buy the paper.
RAZIEH
We have the paper. Go to your
room and I’ll bring you
something to eat.
Razieh guides Mr. Morteza back towards his room. Out of
habit, Mr. Morteza raises his hand for Razieh to take it
and lead him to his room. Razieh avoids taking his hand.
Mr. Morteza looks at Somayeh. A little scared, Somayeh
hides behind the kitchen wall.
SOMAYEH
Mommy… mommy…
Razieh looks at Somayeh.
SOMAYEH (CONT’D)
…he’s peed in his pants.
Now Razieh notices the wet stain on Mr. Morteza’s pants.
She is shocked and wasn’t expecting this. She takes Mr.
Morteza to his bed.
RAZIEH
Sit here… sit.
Mr. Morteza sits on the edge of the bed. Distressed at this
situation, Razieh, careful not to step on the wet spots in
the carpet, walks to the hallway. Somayeh follows her.
RAZIEH
(to Somayeh)
21
Where are you coming? Don’t you
see that it’s unclean here? Go
put your slippers on.
Somayeh goes to the kitchen to put on her slippers. Razieh
looks at Mr. Morteza and the bad situation he is in. She is
at a dilemma as to what to do.
RAZIEH
(to Mr. Morteza)
Can you change your own
clothes?
MR. MORTEZA
Simin…
Razieh puts on the slippers by the front door and walks to
Mr. Morteza’s room. She searches among the clothes on the
coat rack and in the closet for a fresh pair of pants for
Mr. Morteza. She finds a pair of pajamas and a shirt.
RAZIEH
Get up… get up… I’ll take you
to the bathroom.
Mr. Morteza gets up. From the foul odor, Razieh realizes
that he has not only peed in his pants, but he has also
soiled them.
RAZIEH
(upset)
Ah! Can you wash yourself?
INT. CORRIDOR AND BATHROOM – DAY
Razieh enters the bathroom. She hangs Mr. Morteza’s clean
clothing on the peg on the wall. She turns on the water in
the bathtub and brings him into the bathroom.
RAZIEH
Take your clothes off, wash
yourself, and then put these
on… did you understand? Wash
yourself so that you’ll not be
uncomfortable.
Razieh comes out of the bathroom and closes the door. She
(CONTINUED)
22
waits behind the bathroom door in the corridor. She is
worried about Mr. Morteza. Curious, Somayeh is standing in
the corridor. Razieh has placed her ear to the bathroom
door.
RAZIEH
Can you manage?
She waits a little. She pushes the door ajar. Mr. Morteza
is still standing just as he was in the middle of the
bathroom.
RAZIEH
Look, put these pants on…
pants… okay?
Razieh again leaves the bathroom and closes the door. Mr.
Morteza stares blankly at the closed bathroom door.
MR. MORTEZA
Simin…
INT. LANGUAGE INSTITUTE – RECEPTION AND CLASSROOMS – DAY
Simin is holding the phone and is standing in front of the
secretary’s desk in the language institute where she works.
All around the reception area are classrooms and the
students are seen through the half open doors of the
classrooms.
SIMIN
He’d say when he needed to go
to the bathroom… Look, take him
to the bathroom… I can’t come
till 12… I have a class… no…
did you call my husband? Give
him a call. Do you have his
number? Write it down. There’s
a pen on the computer desk in
the hallway… I’ll hold.
Simin waits for the other end of the line. She glances at
the students who are waiting for her to come back to their
class to teach. She is conflicted about what to do.
23
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM –
DAY
Razieh is holding the receiver and it is clear that she is
on the line and waiting for an answer. Mr. Morteza is still
in his soiled clothing and sitting on the edge of his bed.
Somayeh leaves Mr. Morteza and comes to the living room.
Razieh hangs up and looks at Mr. Morteza who is looking at
her innocently.
SOMAYEH
Mommy, he smells.
RAZIEH
Shh! That’s not nice.
Razieh takes out a small notebook from her purse. She calls
a number she has written in it and waits for the other end
to pick up.
RAZIEH
Hello… good day… excuse me I
had a religious question. I am
working at a house. There’s an
old man here. I am here to care
for him. I just saw that he has
wet his pants. They didn’t tell
me that he couldn’t control
himself. I wanted to ask you
what I should do. If I clean
him and change him, will it be
considered a sin…
(pause)
No there is no one else here…
He’s 70 or 80 years old and
he’s senile…
(pause)
I called his son several times
but he is not answering… I
don’t know anyone here…
(pause)
I might accidentally see…
(pause)
The urgency is that the poor
guy has been sitting like this
for half an hour…
(pause)
(MORE)
24
No I will tell his son today
that I can’t anymore…
(pause)
Yes… Yes… All right. Thank you
very much. Sorry to have
bothered you. Goodbye.
Razieh hangs up and goes into the kitchen and gets a pair
of gloves.
SOMAYEH
I won’t tell daddy.
RAZIEH
My little angel.
Razieh goes into Mr. Morteza’s room and closes the door.
Somayeh is curious and walks towards the door. She peeps
through the keyhole and sees her mother who is trying to
take off Mr. Morteza’s clothing and clean him.
EXT. GAS STATION – AFTERNOON
Termeh is pumping gas into Nader’s car. Nader is sitting
behind the wheel and is watching her in the side view
mirror. Some people are looking at Termeh and are
astonished that she is pumping gas. Termeh fills the tank.
Places the nozzle back and comes towards Nader’s window.
Nader gives Termeh two 2000 toman notes. Termeh pays the
gas station attendant and quickly gets in the front
passenger side and gives back the gas card to her father.
TERMEH
(getting in the
car)
Everyone is looking…
NADER
That’s okay sweetheart. How
many?
TERMEH
Thirty-seven and a half…
NADER
Did you get the change?
TERMEH
25
He didn’t give me any…
NADER
Did you ask for it?
TERMEH
It’s his tip.
NADER
A tip is for when he pumps the
gas… you’ll go back and get it
back… quickly.
Termeh gets out and walks towards the attendant. The next
car in line to pump is annoyed and honks his horn. In the
rearview mirror, Nader sees Termeh arguing with the
attendant for the money back. Termeh eventually gets the
money back. Pleased, she gets back in the car. Nader turns
on the car and drives. Termeh holds the money for Nader to
take.
NADER
Keep it.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM –
AFTERNOON
Nader and Termeh rush in. Nader is holding a newspaper.
MRS. GHAHRAEI is sitting behind the dining room table. She
rises when Nader walks in. Razieh is in the kitchen.
NADER
(to Mrs. Ghahraei)
Hello… Sorry we’re late.
TERMEH
Hello.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Hello… How are you Termeh?
TERMEH
I’m well. I’ll go get my books.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
And your test results.
26
Termeh goes to her room to take her bag and bring back her
math books. Nader takes off his coat while walking towards
his father’s room to give him the newspaper he has bought
him. Somayeh is sitting next to Mr. Morteza and is reading
the paper for him.
NADER
(to his father)
How are you? Good?
(to Somayeh)
How are you little lady? Are
you reading the paper for him
or is he reading it for you?
MR. MORTEZA
Has Ali gotten married?
NADER
Who’s Ali?
MR. MORTEZA
Ali.
NADER
(jokingly)
Yes dad… and now it’s your
turn.
Mr. Morteza laughs from the bottom of his heart. Somayeh is
embarrassed and leaves the room. Razieh comes out of the
kitchen and puts on her chador and gets ready to leave.
RAZIEH
(to Somayeh)
Come put your shoes on. We’re
leaving.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
(to Somayeh)
Don’t forget your drawing.
Somayeh collects her drawing and crayons from the dining
room table.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Look after your mom okay?
SOMAYEH
27
Okay.
Somayeh places her drawing and crayons in her backpack.
Nader comes out of Mr. Morteza’s room.
RAZIEH
Hello.
NADER
Hello… You hadn’t tightened the
oxygen valve all the way.
RAZIEH
I did in the morning… he
must’ve opened it.
NADER
From now on tighten it all the
way so that he can’t open it.
RAZIEH
Excuse me but I might not be
able to come here tomorrow.
NADER
(surprised)
You had said you would come
every day!
RAZIEH
The commute is too far.
NADER
I turned someone else away.
It’s 4 pm. how can I find
someone now for tomorrow
morning?
RAZIEH
The work is too much for me.
NADER
Please come here…
Nader goes to the kitchen.
SOMAYEH
28
(pointing to her
shoe)
I can’t get it on my foot.
Razieh helps her get her shoe on.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Maybe you got tired cause it
was your first day.
RAZIEH
No ma’am…
(pointing to Mr.
Morteza’s room)
No. You were here for a few
minutes. You saw… I can’t with
my situation.
(to Somayeh)
Get your bag.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Here’s that doctor’s number.
RAZIEH
Is it a man or a woman?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
A woman. Her secretary knows
me. Tell them Ghahraei sent
you. They also do sonograms.
SOMAYEH
It was kicking in mommy's
tummy.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Cause he wants to come out and
play with you.
RAZIEH
It moved a lot today.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Then it’s definitely a boy.
Razieh laughs and goes to the kitchen. Termeh comes back
with her books and notebooks and sits at the dining room
table next to Mrs. Ghahraei.
29
INT. KITCHEN – AFTERNOON
Nader is pouring water in the tea maker. He presses the
button to boil the water. Razieh is standing in the doorway
to the kitchen. Nader is looking for tea in the kitchen
cupboards to refill the tea canister.
NADER
You had to tell me yesterday.
How can I leave him at home
alone tomorrow?
(to Termeh)
Termeh, where does your mom
keep the tea?
TERMEH (O.S.)
I don’t know.
RAZIEH
You didn’t tell me that I have
to clean him.
NADER
Clean him?
RAZIEH
He soiled his pants today.
Nader stop looking in the cupboards and upset, looks at
Razieh.
RAZIEH
It’s not right for me to clean
him. Please pay me for today so
I can go.
Nader is deep in thought.
RAZIEH
Could you pay me…
NADER
Could you at least come
tomorrow so that I have a
chance to find someone else? I
have to place an ad in the
paper.
30
RAZIEH
There are companies you can
call for a male helper.
NADER
I can’t just let anyone into my
home.
Nader takes out some money out of his pocket and pays
Razieh. Razieh takes the money and leaves.
RAZIEH
Goodbye.
Nader comes to the kitchen. He hears the doorbell. He opens
the door. Razieh is at the door.
NADER
Yes?
RAZIEH
Excuse me but could I give my
husband your number and say I
found it in the paper so that
he could come for this job?
NADER
You tell him about the job and
if he was willing…
RAZIEH
I don’t want him to know that
you know me. I didn’t tell him
I was coming here for work.
NADER
Tell him to call and come see
me tonight…
RAZIEH
It’s late for tonight. I’ll
come tomorrow. Tell him to
start from the day after
tomorrow. And for the pay…
NADER
31
Okay. Tell him to call me.
We’ll arrange to meet at the
bank.
RAZIEH
Thank you.
NADER
Bye and thanks for today.
Razieh goes down the stairs. Nader goes back in and closes

In the commotion of one of the city’s squares, Razieh and
Somayeh, exhausted, are seated on the bench at the bus
station.
INT. BANK – DAY
The guard opens the door. HOJJAT, Razieh’s husband who is a
thin thirty-seven-year-old man enters and walks towards the
counter. Hojjat sits down by one of the desks and is
looking inside the vault room and the stacks of cash, which
Nader is busy counting. Nader signs off on the vault’s end
of the day count and walks towards the bank manager’s desk.
NADER
Hello.
HOJJAT
(recognizes Nader)
Hello sir.
Nader places the vault paperwork on the bank manager’s desk
and walks towards his own desk.
HOJJAT
Sorry I’m a little late.
NADER
That’s okay. Where did you say
you worked before?
HOJJAT
I was a cobbler.
32
NADER
And now you are not working?
HOJJAT
Yes, I am unemployed.
NADER
And you’re okay with cleaning
him? Since yesterday he’s been
soiling himself.
HOJJAT
No that’s no problem. I’ll
treat him like my own father…
NADER
But you’ll be alone with him
and you have to really watch
him.
HOJJAT
Your wife won’t be there?
NADER
No, I am alone for the moment.
HOJJAT
Excuse me but isn’t 300,000 too
little for this work?
NADER
How much did you have in mind?
HOJJAT
I’ve worked for 15 years as a
cobbler. If it’s one thing I’m
not scared of it’s work. I
can’t stand lazy people. I
think you should at least pay
400,000…
NADER
I really can’t pay that.
HOJJAT
I’ll come for a few days. If
you like my work, add something
(MORE)
33
to the 300,000. If not you
don't even have to pay. I can
even start today.
NADER
No there’s someone there today.
I’ll write down the address for
you. Start tomorrow and bring
an ID.

is asleep in his room.
NADER
Guarantee?
TERMEH
Tazmin, zemanat.
NADER
That’s Arabic. The Persian
version.
TERMEH
That’s what’s written in our
book.
NADER
I thought we agreed that you
would never repeat that
sentence. When something is
wrong, it doesn’t matter where
it’s written. For guarantee
write…
Nader thinks for a bit.
TERMEH
She’ll deduct points if I write
anything else.
NADER
That’s okay let her… write
poshtvaneh.
The doorbell rings. Termeh opens the door. Razieh and her
daughter come in.

Hello.
RAZIEH
Hello.

Hello ma’am… Your husband was
supposed to come today!

RAZIEH
He couldn’t make it.
NADER
What about tomorrow? Will he
come?
RAZIEH
I don’t know, if he doesn’t
I’ll come.
NADER
I hope it’s not going to be
like this everyday.
RAZIEH
No poor guy wanted to come.
Last night one of his creditors
came with a police officer and
took him away.
NADER
Yes but if something comes up
and he can’t make it, I need to
know a couple of days in
advance.
RAZIEH
No he will definitely come.
I’ll go see the creditor and
ask to have him agree to
release him. His check has
bounced. He hadn’t come home
for a week for fear of being
arrested.
TERMEH (O.S.)
Dad we’re late!
INT. KITCHEN – DAY
Razieh pulls out the garbage bin from the cupboard under
the kitchen sink. She dumps the waste from the sink in the

(quietly)
Somayeh!
She starts clearing the breakfast table.
INT. MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM – DAY
Somayeh is standing by Mr. Morteza’s bed and is staring at
the oxygen mask that is covering his mouth. She is curious.

it to the left and then the right. At one point, she turns
on the valve too high and wakes Mr. Morteza.

the fact that this is very difficult for her, she is trying
to wash and rinse it. Somayeh comes to the bathroom door.
SOMAYEH
Mommy, it got ripped!
RAZIEH
(frustrated)
Ah!... Where?
SOMAYEH
On the stairs.
RAZIEH
(angry)
Why did you get it on your
clothes? Where the hell am I
going to get you clean clothes?
Take it off!
Razieh is angry at the situation that has occurred. She
takes off Somayeh’s dress with disgust. This causes Somayeh
some pain but she does not show it.
INT. STAIRWAY – DAY
Razieh is in the stairway with a dustpan and sweeper. She
is cleaning up the mess from the torn garbage bag. She
sweeps the garbage into a new garbage bag. Somayeh is
wearing one of Termeh’s clothes, which is too big for her.
She comes to the doorway with a worried look on her face.
SOMAYEH
Mommy… he’s not in his room.
RAZIEH
(worried)
Go see if he’s in the bathroom.
39
Somayeh goes back inside. Razieh is worried. She leaves the
garbage and is waiting for Somayeh to come back. She is
anxious and goes back into the house.
EXT. OUTSIDE NADER’S HOUSE – DAY

both ends of the street. She doesn’t know in which
direction she should go. She runs towards the main
intersection.
EXT. STREET – DAY
Razieh is running forth and searching all around for Mr.
Morteza. She runs to the side of the street and then goes
back to Nader’s street. She stops to catch her breath. She
doesn’t know in which direction and where to look. She
spots a newspaper stand at the end of the street and she
sees Mr. Morteza standing next to it barefoot. He is trying
to cross the busy street. Horrified, she runs towards him.
She is looking at him and crossing the street when she
hears the sound of screeching tires from behind.

holding the bar and is tired. She feels dizzy and almost
falls. A woman behind her holds her up. Another woman
stands up and gives up her seat to Razieh.

INT. NADER’S HOUSE – STAIRWAY – DAY
MRS. KALANI, the upstairs neighbor, is standing outside
Nader’s apartment and is talking to Mr. Morteza whose
distorted silhouette can be seen from behind the glass
door.
MRS. KALANI
Have you had your breakfast? Go
sit down and I’ll call your
son. Don’t go in the kitchen.
Upset, Mrs. Kalani climbs up the stairs. The sound of the
main door to the building is heard. She comes back down the
stairs and waits to see who is coming up the stairs. Razieh
and Somayeh are climbing the stairs. Razieh is climbing the
stairs with difficulty.
MRS. KALANI
My child, this poor old man has
been standing by the door for
half an hour. Why are you so
late?
RAZIEH
My commute is far… hello.
MRS. KALANI
Hello.
Razieh gets the key from the ledge above the door.
MRS. KALANI
And take the trash out with the
can. The liquids pour out of
the bag allover the stairs.
RAZIEH
41
Yesterday I felt dizzy and
dropped the bag. I’ll mop the
stairs today.

climbs the stairs.

street where Termeh’s school is located. The school is out
and the street is full of students and their rides. Nader
is a little late. He slowly drives past the school, and
looks for Termeh. Mrs. Ghahraei comes out of the school.
Some of the students are surrounding her and walking with
her to her car. Termeh is among them. She is showing Mrs.
Ghahraei a model she has made for her final.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – STAIRWAY – DAY
Nader is holding Termeh’s backpack and is going up the
stairs ahead of her. Termeh is holding the paper. They
reach the apartment door. Nader rings the doorbell. Termeh
is tired and bends over to sit on the steps.
NADER
Don’t sit there, it’s wet.
Termeh leans against the wall. Nader again rings the
doorbell. No one answers. He tries the handle. He knocks on
the door. He is perplexed.
NADER
Ma’am… ma’am…
(louder)
Ma’am!
He reaches up on the ledge to look for the key. He does not
find it.
NADER
What was her daughter’s name?
TERMEH
Somayeh.
NADER
42
Somayeh… Somayeh…
Nader is worried. He presses his ear to the door to see if
he might hear something. Nader faces the stairs to the
floor above.
NADER
Mrs. Kalani… Mrs. Kalani…
He climbs several steps. Termeh goes to the door.
TERMEH
Grandpa… grandpa…
The neighbor’s door opens. Nader goes up a couple of steps.
NADER
Mrs. Kalani?
MRS. KALANI (O.S.)
Yes. Hello.
NADER
Hello. Did you see the woman
who works for us?
MRS. KALANI (O.S.)
She was mopping the stairs.
NADER
When?
MRS. KALANI (O.S.)
Just before noon… she’s not
home?

No…

Stay here, I’ll get my key from

Nader and Termeh enter their house. No one is at home. The
door to Mr. Morteza’s room is locked. Nader unlocks the
door and enters the room with Termeh. Mr. Morteza has
fallen off his bed. One of his hands is tied tightly with a
scarf to the bar at the headboard. He has soiled his pants
and his false teeth have fallen out of his mouth. It is
clear that he has been left this way for a long time. Nader
is distraught at seeing his father in this state. He holds
his father’s head and looks at his face. Mr. Morteza’s eyes
are moving. He is alive. Termeh tries to untie her
grandfather’s hand from the bed. Nader helps his father sit
on the edge of the bed. He is angry. Termeh is on the verge
of tears.
NADER
Dad… dad…
Termeh picks up her grandfather’s glasses from the floor.
NADER
Watch him…
(while leaving)
Shameless!
Nader quickly leaves the room. He is angry.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM – DAY
Nader is hurriedly looking through the bedside table and
vanity drawers where valuable documents, money and some
gold are kept. He looks into another drawer in which some

drawer?
TERMEH (O.S.)
No.

kitchen when he spots Somayeh’s backpack left in a corner
by the apartment door. He looks into the kitchen.
INT. MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM – DAY
44
NADER
Who did this to you?
Mr. Morteza stares blankly at Nader.
NADER
Stand up. Stand up.
Nader holds his father under his arms to help him stand. He
lifts his arms up and back down again to make sure he is
not hurt.
NADER
Move your arms… raise them… do
they hurt? Walk a little… walk…
raise your leg… does it hurt
anywhere?
Nader helps his father take a few steps. Termeh is worried
about her grandfather. Mr. Morteza cannot walk easily.
NADER
What’s wrong dad? Does your leg
hurt?
Nader seats his dad at the edge of the bed. He unbuttons
his shirt and undresses him. He examines his body to make
sure he is not hurt. Nader tries to take his father’s pants
off. His father is clinging on to his pants. Termeh is
standing there on the verge of tears.
NADER
I want to see if you’re okay…
let go…
Nader realizes Mr. Morteza is embarrassed of Termeh.
NADER
(to Termeh)
Go stand outside.
TERMEH
Is he hurt?
NADER
No… go outside.
45

(loud to Termeh)
Go to the kitchen and close the
door.
INT. KITCHEN AND HALLWAY – DAY

NADER (O.S.)
Bring me his clothes.
EXT. BALCONY – DAY
Termeh gathers her grandfather’s clothes and towel from the
clothesline.
INT. HALLWAY – DAY – CONT.
Razieh and Somayeh hurriedly enter the house. She is
worried to see that the door is unlocked and that Nader and
Termeh’s shoes are by the door. She enters. She looks at
Mr. Morteza’s empty room. She is clearly scared. Termeh
walks into the hallway from the kitchen with Mr. Morteza’s
clothing and towel. Happy, Somayeh runs towards her.
SOMAYEH
Hello.
Cold and indifferent, Termeh walks towards the bathroom.
From her reaction, Razieh realizes that the situation is
not a good one. Somayeh wants to follow Termeh.
RAZIEH
Come here.
Somayeh stays. Razieh walks towards the kitchen and Somayeh
follows her.
SOMAYEH
Mommy, I’m thirsty.
46
INT. KITCHEN AND HALLWAY – DAY
Razieh is worried about Nader and Termeh’s presence in the
house. She takes a glass and fills it from the tap and
gives it to Somayeh to drink. Upset and angry, Nader comes
to the kitchen.
RAZIEH
Hello.
NADER
Where’ve you been?
RAZIEH
Something came up. I had to
leave for a bit.
NADER
You had no right to leave!
RAZIEH
He was asleep.
NADER
So if he was asleep you should
lock him in and leave?
RAZIEH
I wasn’t gone long.
NADER
(angry)
Not gone long? You’re standing
there, looking into my eyes and
lying?
(angrier)
He was dying when I got home.
RAZIEH
I thought he would sleep like
he does everyday.
NADER
So then when he sleeps, you
should lock him up and leave?
47
Razieh is quiet and a little shocked at Nader’s furious
manner. Somayeh is drinking her water and is scared of
Nader.
NADER
I’m talking to you!
RAZIEH
Has something happened to him?
NADER
Why did you tie his hand to the
bed… huh?
Somayeh holds the empty glass towards her mother.
NADER
What is your responsibility in
this house? To tie this poor
man’s hand to the bed, lock him
up and go after your own
chores?
RAZIEH
I had to go.
NADER
Didn’t I give you money? Why’ve
you gone to the drawer and
taken money?
RAZIEH
(shocked)
I took money?!
NADER
(to Razieh)
Go on. Get out.
RAZIEH
(to Somayeh)
Go wait outside till I come.
Somayeh leaves the house.
RAZIEH
When did I take money?
48
NADER
You didn’t take money? Just get
the hell out!
TERMEH (O.S.)
Dad… come on.
RAZIEH
On the holy martyrs I didn’t…
here, search my bag if there
was any money…
NADER
Get out!
RAZIEH
(on the verge of
tears)
You don’t want to give me what
I’ve earned?
Nader goes towards her to get her out of the house.
NADER
What you’ve earned is a kick
out of here… it’s because your
child is here that I’m not
doing it. Get out!
RAZIEH
(yelling)
Don’t touch me!
NADER
Then get out on your own!
Nader forces her to get out. He follows her to the door and
slams the door behind her.
TERMEH (O.S.)
Dad…
INT. CORRIDOR AND BATHROOM – DAY
Nader walks towards the corridor in which the bathroom is
located.
TERMEH
49
He’s sitting behind the door.
He won’t move back.
Nader tries to push the door open but his father is sitting
behind it and won’t let it open.
NADER
Go back so I can open the door…
get up… get up and move back…
Dad…
Nader tries to push his hand in through the door and push
back his father who is sitting behind the door. He sits
down to do this. Termeh is worried and standing above her
dad. The sound of Razieh knocking on the door is heard.
Nader pushes the door and hears his father moan.
NADER
Dad move over a little!… look
what’s that over there?
The sound of the knocking is louder and Nader is getting
angrier and more frustrated.
NADER
(frustrated)
Dad you’re wearing me out. Go
back…
(angry)
Aren’t I telling you to get
back?
(loud)
MOVE AWAY!
TERMEH
Why are you screaming? He
doesn’t understand.
NADER
(to Termeh)
Didn’t I tell you to watch him?
(to his father)
Get up!
TERMEH
Maybe his leg is hurt and he
can’t get up.
50
NADER
(with a
threatening tone
at his father)
Get back! Get back I said!
Nader is forced to push the door open. The door opens
suddenly and his father is pushed to the bathroom floor.
The doorbell rings.
NADER
(to his father)
Why do you hurt me so much?
Mr. Morteza is staring at Nader with a blank look on his
face. Now the sound of Razieh knocking at the door has
driven Nader insane. Angry, he comes out of the bathroom.
INT. CORRIDOR AND STAIRWAY – DAY
Razieh opens the door to the apartment and walks in.
NADER
(angry at Razieh)
With whose permission did you
come in?
RAZIEH
(worried)
I want to know what has
happened to him.
NADER
That’s none of your business!
Give me that key and get out!
RAZIEH
I didn’t steal anything. If I
had…
NADER
I don’t want you to explain.
Just get out.
RAZIEH
Pay me for today and I’ll
leave.
51
The sound of the neighbor’s door opening.
NADER
Pay you for what?
RAZIEH
(on the verge of
tears)
I come here with my child from…
(crying)
I swear on the prophet, I
didn’t take any money.
NADER
Get out and cry all you want.
RAZIEH
I won’t leave till I get my
money.
Nader lunges towards her and grabs her by the shoulder to
get her out.
RAZIEH
(screaming)
Don’t touch me!
Nader pushes her out and slams the door shut and locks it.
Angry, he walks towards the corridor. Termeh is standing in
the corridor terrified and in disbelief. Nader goes into
the bathroom. Termeh, worried, walks to the door and
listens to see what has happened. Razieh’s voice has
silenced. Worried, Termeh cracks the door open. She sees
Razieh sitting at the foot of the stairs and is in such
pain that she cannot even scream. Razieh can hardly
breathe. Somayeh is standing above her mother and crying. A
neighbor, Mrs. Kalani is trying to help her. A couple of
the neighbors are standing in the stairway. Mrs. Kalani is
rubbing her shoulders.
MRS. KALANI
What happened?
Razieh is trying to get up.
MRS. KALANI
Sit for a bit… don’t get up…
52
Unaware of her surroundings, Razieh gets up with
difficulty. Upset, she takes her daughter’s hand, gathers
her chador around her and leaves. Upset, Termeh comes
inside and closes the door.
INT. BATHROOM – DAY
Nader turns on the water. He holds the handheld shower over
his father who is sitting on the edge of the bathtub. He
takes a loofah to wash him. While scrubbing him, he notices
a wound on his father’s elbow. He starts to cry. He regrets
and is embarrassed by the way he earlier scolded his
father. He holds his father’s head in his arms just like a
father would his child, kisses him.
EXT. STREET OUTSDIE SIMIN’S PARENTS’ HOME – DUSK
Nader is behind the wheel. His father is sitting quietly in
the front passenger seat. Termeh is in the back seat and
has her schoolbag and an overnight bag with her. They drive
up and stop outside an old apartment building. Termeh
gathers her things to get out of the car.
NADER
Tell her to work with you on
your English lessons.
TERMEH
Bye grandpa.
NADER
(to his dad)
Dad Termeh says bye.
Mr. Morteza does not reply. Termeh gets out and jumps over
the street gutter and walks over to her grandmother’s
house. Nader is waiting for her to go in. Termeh rings the
doorbell. She speaks on the intercom. She then comes back
to the street. Nader lowers his window. Termeh wants to
cross and come over to the car.
NADER
Don’t cross… what is it?
TERMEH
Mom wants you to come in.
NADER
53
Tell her I can’t, that
grandpa’s in the car.
TERMEH
She says it’s important.
INT. SIMIN’S PARENTS’ HOUSE – NIGHT
A simple and old apartment. GRANDMA KATTI (Simin’s mother)
opens the door on Nader. Simin’s dad who is seventy years
old is seated on a chair in a corner and because of his
ailing leg, is praying in that position. A young SATELLITE
TV TECHNICAN is standing in front of the television set and
is organizing the channels on the satellite TV receiver.
Simin puts on a headscarf to come out of her room.
NADER
Hello.
GRANDMA KATTI
Hello. You haven’t yet divorced
your wife and you’re ignoring
us.
NADER
I’m busy.
GRANDMA KATTI
People divorce their wives to
get less busy.
Simin comes out of her room to the living room. Nader has
taken a few steps inside the house. They are both in a
sullen state and cold towards each other.
SIMIN
Where’s Termeh?
NADER
Dad’s in the car. She stayed
with him.
GRANDMA KATTI
Then bring him in too.
NADER
No he’s tired. It’s time for
his nap.
54
SATELLITE TV TECHNICIAN
Ma’am, these channels have too
much static.
GRANDMA KATTI
Okay just set the ones you can.
SIMIN
(to Nader)
Did you fight with that woman
today?
NADER
Which woman?
SIMIN
Razieh.
NADER
Did she come see you?
SIMIN
Her sister-in-law called.
NADER
Shameless!
SIMIN
What did she do?
NADER
Tied the old man to the bed and
locked the door. Went after her
own errands. If I’d gotten
there 10 minutes later I
would’ve lost him.
SIMIN
(worried)
Did anything happen to Dad?
NADER
He had fallen off the bed. I
don’t know for how long the
poor thing was like that.
SIMIN
55
Where had she gone?
NADER
How should I know?
SIMIN
She said you hit her.
NADER
I hit her? Nonsense.
SIMIN
Then why is she in hospital?
NADER
(shocked)
Hospital? Why? What happened?
SIMIN
You’re asking me?
NADER
I just pushed her out of the
house.
SIMIN
The sister-in-law was cursing
me nonstop.
NADER
Saying what?
SIMIN
That if she dies, her blood
will be on your hands. Stuff
like that.
Nader is clearly worried. SIMIN’S FATHER has finished
saying his prayers.
SIMIN’S FATHER
Go to the hospital and find out
what’s happened… you might be
in trouble… Hello.
NADER
(to Simin’s
father)
56
Hello.
(to Simin)
She didn’t say what happened?
SIMIN
I hung up. She started cursing.
Frustrated, Nader sits down on the chair next to her.
NADER
That’s what you get for hiring
people off the streets.
SIMIN
Don’t blame me. I told Termeh
to tell you that I don’t know
her and only know her sister-
in-law.
NADER
Which hospital is she at?
INT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT
In a hospital in the south of Tehran with dated interiors,
Nader walks towards the reception. Simin is behind him. A
middle-aged woman is sitting at reception and is on the
phone.
RECEPTIONIST
(to Nader)
Yes?
(on the phone)
Hold.
NADER
Excuse me but a patient, a
woman, by the name of Razieh
was brought in…
RECEPTIONIST
What’s her last name?
SIMIN
We don’t know her last name but
she was brought in earlier this
evening.
57
NADER
Her husband’s family name is
Samadi…
RECEPTIONIST
Why was she brought in?
Nader and Simin don’t know what to say.
NADER
We don’t know. We just heard
that she is not well and that
they’ve brought her here.
The receptionist looks over her papers.
RECEPTIONIST
(reading from one
of the papers)
Razieh… Asnaghi?
SIMIN
She is a woman in her thirties.
RECEPTIONIST
Visiting hours are over. She’s
had surgery and has been
transferred to the ward.
NADER
What kind of surgery?
RECEPTIONIST
She had a miscarriage.
By hearing this news, Nader becomes extremely upset and
moves to a corner and stands there.
SIMIN
Is she okay?
RECEPTIONIST
Yes, she’s fine.
SIMIN
Is her family here?
RECEPTIONIST
58
They were here… they might be
at the end of this corridor
now.
Simin walks towards Nader who is upset and standing in a
corner.
SIMIN
What did you do to her?
NADER
(upset at Simin)
What did I do to her?
INT. END OF A CORRIDOR – NIGHT
Several rows of benches are placed in a square-shaped area
at the end of the corridor. A television set is installed
on a column and is showing the news. The next of kin of
patients are seated on the benches in silence and some of
them have dozed off. Among them is Hojjat, Razieh’s
husband. He is watching TV. Simin and Nader walk though the
corridor to this waiting area. Nader spots Hojjat and
cautiously approaches him. Nader is followed by Simin.
NADER
Hello.
HOJJAT
Hello… How are…
(he recognizes
him)
Hello… How are you?
NADER
Thank you very much… How is
she?
HOJJAT
(puzzled)
Who?
NADER
Your wife.
HOJJAT
They transferred her to the
ward… Did you know her?!
59
SIMIN
Yes… I knew her.
Hojjat is a little suspicious. Nader and Simin, who weren’t
expecting this calm reaction from him, do not know what
reason to give for their presence at the hospital.
SIMIN
Can we see her?
Hojjat’s sister, AZAM now arrives with some cake and fruit
juice. She knows Simin.
AZAM
(to Hojjat)
They didn’t have any
sandwiches.
SIMIN
Hello.
Azam ignores her on purpose.
HOJJAT
(to Nader and
Simin)
How do you know my wife?
SIMIN
I know her through your sister.
She introduced her to me for
work.
AZAM
(sarcastically to
Simin)
Thanks a lot!
HOJJAT
(to Nader)
She was coming to your house
for work?
NADER
Apparently you were unable to
come so she came in your place.
60
AZAM
(to Hojjat)
Sit down and eat something.
HOJJAT
(to Nader)
She came to take care of your
father?
NADER
Only for a few days.
HOJJAT
And why didn’t you tell me this
that day?
NADER
I thought she would tell you
herself.
HOJJAT
Why have you come here?
SIMIN
We thought if there is
something we can…
AZAM
Like what? You killed her child
and now you want to raise her
dead?
HOJJAT
(to Azam)
But she said she fell!
AZAM
What did you want her to say?
That I went somewhere and
worked myself to death and
instead of paying me they beat
me.
Upon hearing this Hojjat lunges at Nader catching him off
guard and slaps him hard. Nader holds Hojjat’s hand to stop
him from hitting him again. Azam tries to stop Hojjat who
is no longer in control. Simin stands in front of Nader to
(CONTINUED)
61
stop Hojjat from hitting him. Other people surround them.
One of Hojjat’s blows strikes Simin’s face and nose. Nader
pushes Hojjat back and defends Simin. People take Hojjat to
the side. Hojjat yells and curses.
AZAM
(yelling at Nader)
Why in God’s name did you come
here?
Worried, Simin takes Nader to another side. Nader doesn’t
object and sits down in a corner. His shirt is torn.
SIMIN
Don’t sit here. Let’s go. Get
up…
Nader looks up and sees Simin bleeding from her nose.
INT. NADER’S CAR – EXT. STREET – NIGHT
Nader is behind the wheel with a disheveled look. Simin is
sitting in the passenger side seat with her head tilted
back. She is lightly bruised under her eyes. She is holding
a napkin to her nose.
NADER
Do you want me to push back you
chair?
Simin shakes her head to imply no.
NADER
I’ll take you home and then
I’ll go get Dad and Termeh.
SIMIN
No.
NADER
What do you mean no?! You want
to go to your parents’ in your
state?!
Simin doesn’t respond.
NADER
62
It’s over. You’re coming back
home tonight.
SIMIN
I don’t want to.
Nader is shocked at her response and doesn’t continue the
discussion.
INT. COURTHOUSE – CORRIDORS – DAY
In the busy and crowded corridors of the courthouse, Nader
is in search of the branch he has been summoned to. He is
holding a piece of paper in his hand. Among the many faces
seated in the corridor, he spots Somayeh, Razieh’s
daughter, sitting by herself. She is absorbed by the people
in handcuffs or in prison uniforms. Through a partially
opened door, Nader spots Hojjat who is busy speaking to the
examining magistrate’s assistant. A few feet behind him, is
Razieh standing next to the door. Nader waits for them to
finish and come out before going inside. Now Somayeh sees
Nader. She doesn’t know whether she should say hello or
ignore him. Nader is looking at her kindly. Hojjat and
Razieh come out of the room. They are not expecting to see
Nader. They pass each other without any kind of exchange.
Razieh still looks pale and sickly. Nader goes in. Hojjat
looks at Nader hatefully. Razieh takes her daughter’s hand
and walk towards the door to leave but it seems like Hojjat
wants to stay.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S ROOM – DAY
In a room with a window, which opens to the crowded
courtyard of the courthouse, Hojjat and Razieh are seated
on chairs opposite the examining magistrate‘s desk. Nader
is seated two chairs over. Between them is an empty chair.
The door is ajar and the people and the traffic from the
room next door are heard. The secretary who is a young man
is seated behind another desk and is on the phone. The
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE makes notes according to their
answers.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
So… Mr. Hojjat Samadi and Ms.
Razieh…
HOJJAT
Asnaghi.
63
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Is that you ma’am?
RAZIEH
Yes.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
And you are Mr. Nader Lavasani…
(to Razieh)
Okay so what’s your complaint?
HOJJAT
May I speak?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
You filed a joint complaint.
Either of you may speak.
HOJJAT
My wife was working in this
man’s home. Without my
permission of course. This man
accuses her of stealing. He
pushes her down the stairs and
she falls and loses my child.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Do you have the medical
examiner’s report?
HOJJAT
It’s on your desk.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
On what date was this?
HOJJAT
What date was Wednesday?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Nader)
You heard the accusation? Do
you accept the charge? What is
your defense?
NADER
(upset)
64
I am sorry, when I heard I was
very upset. I got up and went
to the hospital.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Then you accept that you did
this?
(pointing to the
medical examiner’s
report and to
Hojjat)
Did you get this on that day
from the medical examiner’s
office?
HOJJAT
That night we went to the
hospital. We took the hospital
file to the medical examiner’s
office.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(reading from the
report)
Four and a half months… male…
(to Nader)
Well, explain.
NADER
I accept that I was a little
too harsh with her.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
What is harsh? Did you push
this lady?
NADER
I didn’t push her. I tried to
get her out of the house.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Look sir. Please be clear.
You’ve been charged with
manslaughter. The fetus was at
four-and-a-half months and
counts as a complete human
adult.
65
Nader is completely shocked at the magistrate’s words.
NADER
I didn’t approach her with the
intent of pushing her… I wanted
her to leave so that I could
close the door to my house.
RAZIEH
(shocked)
You didn’t push me?!
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Ma’am, please.
NADER
If I knew she were pregnant, I
wouldn’t even try to get her
out of the house like that. I
just wanted her to leave.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Ma’am Do you agree with his
explanation?
RAZIEH
He didn’t push me. He grabbed
me here and threw me out and I
fell on the stairs.
NADER
I didn’t throw her. Like I said
I wanted to get her to leave my
house.
HOJJAT
You jerk, who gets a pregnant
woman to leave their house this
way?
NADER
I didn’t know she was pregnant.
HOJJAT
Why are you lying?
NADER
66
I found out at the hospital.
RAZIEH
Your honor, you’re like an
older brother to me, can't
everyone tell from the
appearance and body of a woman
that she is pregnant…
HOJJAT
4 to 5 months pregnant.
NADER
When did I even have a chance
to see you? I was already gone
or leaving when you'd arrive.
When I’d come back in the
afternoon, you always had your
chador on and were leaving. In
fact whenever I’d see you, you
always looked like this with
the chador. How would I know
you…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Razieh)
He can claim that he couldn’t
tell from your appearance.
NADER
Besides, your honor, I would
never think that a pregnant
woman would apply for this kind
of work.
RAZIEH
Your honor, I spoke of my
pregnancy in front of him, his
daughter and her private tutor
who comes to their house. They
all heard it.
NADER
When? I don’t remember.
HOJJAT
No of course you wouldn't
remember.
67
NADER
Anyway, the issue isn't that I
knew or not.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Yes it is! If it’s proven that
you knew, the court can
sentence you to 1 to 3 years in
prison…. Well?
NADER
I didn’t know.
RAZIEH
His daughter’s tutor can
testify. Let her come in and
say that he didn’t hear me.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Can she come in tomorrow?
NADER
Your honor, I don’t want her or
the school involved. That’s not
good for my child.
HOJJAT
(angry)
You trash. You’ve killed my
child. It's bad for your child?
NADER
Don’t insult me.
HOJJAT
(a bit more calm)
Your child is human but ours
was an animal?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Hojjat)
Don't insult.
HOJJAT
Am I insulting or he who took
(MORE)
68
my poor pregnant wife to clean
the shit between his father’s
legs?
NADER
Ma’am did I force you to come?
You came for…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Hojjat)
Look, if you disrupt the order
here, I ‘ll put you in prison
for three days.
RAZIEH
(to the Examining
Magistrate)
Please he's a bit hot-tempered…
HOJJAT
(to Razieh)
Hot-tempered? I should sue you
for secretly working for a
strange, single man whom no one
knows…
RAZIEH
(in tears)
I only wanted to help with the
bills. Your honor, he hasn’t
worked for months.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
The tutor has to come in as a
witness.
(to Nader)
Call her to come in tomorrow or
give her number to Mr. Izadi to
arrange it.
Razieh has not yet stopped crying.
RAZIEH
Your honor I’m here today for
one thing… I lost my child but
it didn’t hurt as much as when
he accused me of being a thief…
69
HOJJAT
If we were thieves, we wouldn’t
have to come to your homes for
work.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Nader)
Do you have proof or a witness
that she stole?
NADER
I didn’t say she stole? I went
to my drawer, and saw that my
money was short. And it was the
same amount that I pay her.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Why did you fight?
HOJJAT
He accused her of stealing.
NADER
Your honor, my father is 80
years old. He is sick. He has
Alzheimer’s. She tied his hand
to the bed and left the house.
That day I came home early. I
saw him on the floor with his
hand tied to the bed. I thought
he had died. She came back and
I’m not saying I wasn’t angry,
I was. I told her to leave and
she was being stubborn and
wouldn’t leave.
RAZIEH
Your honor, where should I have
gone? He accused me of
stealing. If I hadn’t asked for
the money and left, he would’ve
thought I had stolen the money.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Was your father hurt?
NADER
Yes he was a little hurt.
70
Razieh gets upset at hearing this. She looks at the window
and then gets up to leave the room.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Ma’am sit down. Where are you
going?
RAZIEH
(pointing to the
window)
My daughter is going outside!
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Come back quick. And close the
door.
Razieh leave and closes the door behind her.
INT. CORRIDORS – DAY
With the excuse of checking up on her daughter, Razieh
comes out of the examination branch and walks through the
crowded and busy corridors towards the exit. She is
preoccupied with something.
EXT. COURTYARD – DAY
She reaches the courtyard. She looks around and spots her
daughter playing in a corner of the yard. She walks towards
her. She spots a public telephone in the corner of the
yard. Doubtful, she changes her direction and walks towards
the public phone. She waits for the person who is on the
phone to finish their conversation. She is a little
worried. She gets a little notebook out of her bag. She
uses her broken glasses to read a number out of it. Her
turn to use the phone comes up. She dials the number. She
is waiting for the other end to pick up. She sees Hojjat
who has come to the courtyard looking for her. She hangs up
before Hojjat can see her and walks towards Hojjat.
HOJJAT
Why are you taking so long?
RAZIEH
I’m not well. You go I’ll come.
HOJJAT
71
He says you locked up his
father and left.
RAZIEH
What should I say?
HOJJAT
Say? If he files a complaint
you’ll be arrested.
Razieh doesn’t know what to do. It is clear she is in a
difficult situation.
RAZIEH
You go on. I’ll come.
Hojjat leaves. Razieh is upset and full of doubt. She goes
back inside. Somayeh is standing in a corner and looking at
a small kitten that in the midst of all this commotion, is
standing by a prisoner’s foot. The prisoner is in handcuffs
and is in prison uniform. A guard is sitting next to him.
The prisoner is throwing his leftover food from a plastic
plate on the ground for the little kitten. The kitten is
eating it and rubbing itself against the prisoner’s leg.
Somayeh is curious and walks towards them and stands there
and watches the kitten.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE – DAY
Now, Nader, Hojjat and Razieh are all standing in front of
the examining magistrate’s desk. They are all more
distraught than before. The door is still open and other
people waiting to see the magistrate are all standing in
line by the door with their files in their hands.
RAZIEH
He was sleeping. I locked the
door to keep him in. His son
would lock the door and leave
me the key in the mornings. I
saw that he does it so I…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
He says you tied him to the
bed.
RAZIEH
72
I was afraid he would wake up
and do something to hurt
himself. I swear on the Absent
Imam that I did it out of
compassion for him.
NADER
The question is why did you
leave your place of work.
HOJJAT
So if she left you should hit
her? Who said you could touch
my wife? If honor’s not
important for you, it is for
me.
NADER
Don’t be offensive.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Hojjat)
Sir, leave the room… go on.
NADER
I want to file a complaint
against this woman.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Write your complaint. Take your
father to the medical examiner.
If he’s hurt, get a report.
HOJJAT
What happens to our complaint?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Hojjat)
Sign this and leave.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Nader)
Call someone to post bail or
bring a deed for you.
NADER
(extremely
shocked)
73
Bail for what?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
You’re charged with murder. I
can’t let you leave. The blood
money is forty-million tomans.
NADER
How am I going to post bail or
bring a deed? I live at my
dad’s.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Without bail you’ll go to jail…
come and sign here.
It is clear that Razieh is upset from the situation Nader
is in. She comes forward with Hojjat and both sign the
paperwork. Nader is helpless.
NADER
(pleading)
Your honor, my father is sick
and he’s home alone right now.
I couldn’t find anyone to watch
him. I had to lock him in and
come here. My daughter will be
back from school this
afternoon. No one will be there
to watch them. I’ll leave you
my ID, my pay slips, whatever
you want but if I go to jail my
dad and my daughter… Please.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Look sir, it’s not in my hands.
It's the law.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S MANAGER’S OFFICE – DAY
Nader is on the phone. The room is crowded and other people
are all speaking to the office manager.
NADER
(on the phone)
What about the guys at the
bank?
(MORE)
74
(pause)
What about Tavassoli?
(pause)
In whose name is it?
(pause)
Is your wife home now?
(pause)
Can you speak to her?
(pause)
Please Bahman, just let me know
ASAP. If the deed isn’t here in
an hour, I have to go to jail…
uhum… if I call in ten minutes
will you know?
(pause)
Okay.
(pause)
No thanks.
Nader is very upset. He hangs up the receiver and again
picks it up to call another number. The office manager
objects.
OFFICE MANAGER
How many calls do you make?
NADER
I just want to leave a message.
OFFICE MANAGER
Hurry up so this place clears
up.
Nader takes the receiver and makes another call. He waits.
While he waits, he sees through the open door that Hojjat
and his wife have not left yet.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM, HALLWAY, KITCHEN –
NIGHT.
Termeh comes out of the kitchen and goes to the bathroom to
wash her hands. Simin has come there and walks towards the
answering machine. She listens to Nader’s message.
NADER
(recorded message)
Hello, Termeh… I got tied up
(MORE)
75
here today. They’re keeping me
tonight. Don’t worry about
anything. It’s nothing. It’s
just that tonight you’ll have
to be on your own. Keep an eye
on everything. Take grandpa to
the bathroom regularly. Kisses.
Take care. I’ll call you again
tomorrow.
During the message’s entire playback, Simin gets up and
walks toward Mr. Morteza’s room. Mr. Morteza is quiet and
sometimes looks at Simin. Simin is in conflict with
herself. Termeh comes out of the bathroom.
TERMEH
If you hadn’t left, Dad
wouldn’t be in jail right now.
SIMIN
Your dad is not in jail because
of what I did. It’s because
he’s beaten up a pregnant woman
like a thug.
TERMEH
She came cause you left.
SIMIN
(with sarcasm)
And he was just so upset that I
left.
TERMEH
He knew you weren’t really
leaving.
Simin falls silent for a moment. She is pensive.
SIMIN
Did you tell him?!
TERMEH
He found out.
SIMIN
Say the truth. You told him?
76
Termeh does not respond.
SIMIN
Get your stuff. We’re leaving…
TERMEH
I won’t come. I have homework
to do.
SIMIN
I’ll leave you and if you die
of fright I….
TERMEH
Fine.
SIMIN
If you call I’m going to let
you have it.
Termeh does not respond. Simin sits Mr. Morteza down on the
sofa and walks into the kitchen to get some things.
INT. SIMIN’S CAR – EXT. STREET – NIGHT
Mr. Morteza is sitting quietly on the passenger side chair.
He is staring ahead blankly. Simin is behind the wheel and
is driving.
SIMIN
Not a word to say don’t do
this, don’t leave or I won’t
divorce you… Not a word… “One
day you came to live with me
and now you don’t want to!”…
It's not as if I lived with him
for 14 years.
A brief silence ensues. She is very upset.
SIMIN
If he’d say “I won’t divorce
you,” or he’d fight with me, or
make excuses, it wouldn’t hurt
this much…
She now begins to cry.
77
SIMIN
Child! Only our child? That’s
it? Whether I’m there or not it
doesn’t matter…
The entire time Simin is speaking, Mr. Morteza is staring
at her. It is clear that he has not understood anything of
what Simin has just said. Simin pulls over by the side of
the street. She thinks a little. She is worried. She makes
a U-turn on that very busy street and goes back.
EXT. COURTHOUSE – COURTYARD – DAY
Nader is walking through the courtyard towards the
building. He is handcuffed to an officer. From his
expression it is clear that he has spent a difficult night
in jail. Termeh seems to be waiting for him. Upon seeing
him, she walks towards him. Nader is shocked to see her
here.
TERMEH
Dad… Hi.
NADER
What are you doing here? Who’d
you come with?
Termeh sees her father’s hand handcuffed to the young
officer’s. She looks like she is going to cry and cannot
say anything.
NADER
Why aren’t you at school?
Didn’t you have an exam today?
TERMEH
No it's tomorrow.
Nader, Termeh and the officer walk towards the building and
the corridor.
NADER
Who brought you here?
TERMEH
Mom has brought Grandma’s deed.
78
Nader is a little surprised at hearing this.
INT. CORRIDOR – EXT. COURTYARD – DAY
Nader and Termeh enter the corridor. He glances at the
other end of the corridor and sees Hojjat, his wife and
their daughter sitting and waiting. Somayeh’s gaze is at
Termeh. Nader sees Grandma Katti and along with Termeh and
the officer, they walk towards her.
NADER
Hello.
GRANDMA KATTI
Shouldn’t you tell us you’re in
trouble so we can bring a deed?
NADER
I didn’t want to trouble you.
GRANDMA KATTI
Silly man.
NADER
(to Termeh)
Where’s grandpa?
GRANDMA KATTI
He’s safe. He’s at our house.
Come and sit.
OFFICER
No ma’am he can’t. I have to
take him to the examining
magistrate.
GRANDMA KATTI
(to Nader)
What are they saying? “My
child” as if their eighteen-
year old son was stabbed to
death on the street.
NADER
Did you speak to them?
GRANDMA KATTI
79
You can’t even speak to the
man. I told the wife you’re
young. You can try next year.
Honestly!
Simin walks towards them with the deed and other documents
in her hand. She is still cold towards Nader.
GRANDMA KATTI
What happened?
SIMIN
I have to take someone to
appraise the house.
NADER
Hello.
SIMIN
Hi.
(to Grandma Katti
and Termeh)
You stay here. I’ll be back.
Simin leaves. She walks from the corridor to the courtyard.
From her face, it is clear that she has had a difficult
night.
INT. SECURITY DESK – DAY
The FEMALE OFFICER at security is looking through all the
cell phones in her drawer to find Simin’s cell phone. Simin
is standing in front of the desk waiting to get her cell
phone before she leaves. Mrs. Ghahraei who has just walked
in, sees her.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Hi Mrs. Lavasani.
The female officer hands Simin her cell phone.
SIMIN
Hi.
(to the female
officer)
Thank you.
(to Mrs. Ghahraei)
How are you?
80
MRS. GHAHRAEI
It’s a good thing I saw you.
What happened? Is it true that…
SIMIN
Yes unfortunately. He pushed
her and she fell and lost her
baby.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
(worried)
So what should I tell them?
SIMIN
I don’t know what they’ll ask.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
What if he asks something that…
FEMALE OFFICER
(to Mrs. Ghahraei)
Ma’am, your cellphone.
Simin doesn’t know how to answer Mrs. Ghahraei’s question.
Mrs. Ghahraei hands over her cellphone to the female
officer.
SIMIN
(to Mrs. Ghahraei)
You should tell the truth.
(walking towards
the exit)
Excuse me but I have to go and
take care of this deed.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Okay.
Simin leaves.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE – DAY
Sitting in front of the examining magistrate’s office, are
Hojjat and Razieh. They are on one side of Mrs. Ghahraei
and Nader is on the other. Mrs. Ghahraei is answering
questions.
81
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Where was he?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Mr. Lavasani was in the
Kitchen.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Did he have any reaction or
contribute to your
conversation?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
If he did, I didn’t notice.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
How did you realize she was
pregnant?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
I think she told me.
RAZIEH
Ma’am you asked me. Why would I
tell you?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Oh yes her daughter was drawing
a man and a woman. She said
this is my daddy and mommy. I
said your mommy’s not that fat.
She said she has a baby in her
tummy.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
So you didn’t find out from her
appearance?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
No.
HOJJAT
Why are you lying? You’re a
woman. Women can tell from the
face of a woman if she’s
pregnant.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
82
Even if I could tell, what
difference does it make to Mr.
Lavasani?
HOJJAT
This woman is his daughter’s
tutor. They’ve fixed their
stories.
NADER
Why are you insulting this
lady?
HOJJAT
No one’s talking to you.
NADER
When did I have the opportunity
to fix my story? I was in here
last night!
RAZIEH
Your honor, it is obvious. Now
that I am speaking to you, even
if that man…
(pointing to the
secretary)
…doesn’t want to, he can hear
us.
(to the secretary)
Right?
NADER
I didn’t hear you. My mind is
in a thousand places. Why would
I listen to your conversation?
Do I have to swear to God?
HOJJAT
Like you even believe in God
and the prophet that…
NADER
No God and the prophet are for
your type only!
MRS. GHAHRAEI
83
(to the examining
magistrate)
He is an honorable man. I’ve
been going there for a year to
teach his daughter. He doesn’t
come into the living room till
I’m done teaching his daughter.
He stays in his room.
NADER
Why when she’s pregnant would
she not tell me about it? Why
would she hide it and come and
take this job? If I had known,
I wouldn’t have even hired her.
HOJJAT
Why did you hire her when you
knew she didn’t have her
husband’s permission to work?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Mrs. Ghahraei)
You may go.
INT. CORRIDOR – DAY
Grandma Katti has her reading glasses on. She is taking
this opportunity to quiz Termeh from her book. Termeh is
sitting on one side of Grandma Katti and Somayeh is sitting
to the other side with a slight space between them. She is
curious about Termeh’s answers to her grandmother’s
questions.
TERMEH
During the rule of the
Sassanian Dynasty, people were
divided into two classes, the
royalty and nobility and the
ordinary people.
GRANDMA KATTI
(correcting her)
The common people.
Mrs. Ghahraei walks out of the examining magistrate’s
department and walks towards them.
84
TERMEH
Ma’am what did they ask?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
They wanted to know whether
your dad knew Somayeh’s mom was
pregnant or not.
GRANDMA KATTI
We’ve caused you all this
trouble.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
There's nothing to forgive.
(to Somayeh)
Sweetie, how did mommy lose her
baby?
SOMAYEH
She got a tummy ache.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Why?... Did daddy fight with
her at home?
GRANDMA KATTI
(trying to get
Somayeh to
explain)
Why should he fight with her?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
(to Somayeh)
Maybe because she didn’t tell
him she was working in people’s
home? Did he hit her?
SOMAYEH
My mom and dad never fight.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
Then why were they fighting in
your drawing that day? You
showed me.
SOMAYEH
They didn’t fight anymore.
85
MRS. GHAHRAEI
You’re sure?
Somayeh is quiet and does not respond.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE – DAY
Nader and Hojjat are standing in front of the examining
magistrate’s desk and Razieh is sitting on a chair.
HOJJAT
Yesterday he says I didn’t know
she was pregnant. Today he says
I didn't push her.
(to Razieh)
Why aren’t you saying anything?
RAZIEH
(to Nader)
You didn’t push me?
NADER
I grabbed her here and sent her
back from the door. And that’s
because she was cussing in
front of my daughter.
RAZIEH
When did I cuss at you?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Nader)
Then how did she lose the baby?
NADER
I’d also like to know what
really happened.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Look forget “I got her out of
the house but I didn’t push
her.” What’s the distance
between the door and the
stairs? Two or three meters?
What else could’ve happened to
cause her miscarriage?
86
HOJJAT
(to Nader)
If you hadn’t done anything
wrong, why'd you come to the
hospital to see what was wrong
with her?
NADER
I came out of decency.
HOJJAT
Where was your decency when you
hit her?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Was anyone there during the
fight?
RAZIEH
Yes the neighbors were there.
EXAINING MAGISTRATE
I’ll order questionings.
HOJJAT
The neighbors are in it too
just like the teacher.
NADER
Your honor, he’s been insulting
me from the start! I can also…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to Hojjat)
I’m the one who determines
whether they’re together or
who’s telling the truth and
who’s lying. You be quiet on
this matter.
HOJJAT
Sir do you realize his ex-wife
has posted his bail?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Ma’am do you have someone to
vouch for you?
87
RAZIEH
What do you mean?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
A government employee or
business-owner to vouch for
you.
HOJJAT
What for?
RAZIEH
I don’t have anyone. It’s just
my husband who is unemployed at
the moment.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
You need someone to vouch for
you. You’ve been accused.
RAZIEH
(worried)
What’ve I been accused of?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
According to the complaint he
filed…
HOJJAT
He had no right to do that!
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
She admitted that she tied his
father to the bed, locked him
up and left.
RAZIEH
I explained to you why…
HOJJAT
This poor thing just lost her
baby…
(to Nader)
Aren’t you ashamed? You call
yourself a man?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
88
Sir bring your voice down!
HOJJAT
For God’s sake why don’t you
listen to us? He’s twisting
everything.
(angry and
screaming)
He beat my wife and killed my
child. What could be clearer?
Why do you want to trample on a
poor soul’s rights?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
If you disturb the order, I’ll
send you to jail for 3 days.
HOJJAT
I’ve lost everything. You think
I fear jail? You should fear
God.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to his secretary)
Call security to send an
officer to arrest him.
The secretary picks up the phone to make the call. Worried,
Razieh goes towards him and stops him rom dialing the
number.
RAZIEH
Sir for the sake of the Qoran,
don’t!
(to Hojjat)
Go out and be quiet.
HOJJAT
(distraught)
Why be quiet? So they can
trample my rights?
Razieh is trying to get Hojjat out of the room.
HOJJAT
(on his way out)
I worked for ten years with a
(MORE)
89
cobbler. They fired me. I filed
a thousand complaints, went to
a thousand courthouses, after a
year of going back and forth,
nothing…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
(to his secretary)
Call the gate and let them know
he’s not to leave.
Nader is standing there politely. Hojjat can be heard from
the corridor.
INT. CORRIDOR – EXT. THE COURTYARD – DAY
Distraught, Hojjat comes out of the room. Worried, Razieh
is trying to clam him. All the people present are watching
them and some have gathered around them.
HOJJAT
I swear on the prophet, I won’t
let you trample my rights this
time… I’ll pour gas on myself
and set myself on fire at this
very courthouse…
Grandma Katti has also come forth to watch. Razieh is
scared. Termeh and Somayeh who are in the courtyard feeding
the little kitten from the day before, are now paying
attention to what’s going on inside. An officer has come to
take Hojjat away.
RAZIEH
(to the officer)
Forgive us. He’ll calm down
now.
The officer ignores her and takes Hojjat. With no other
choice, Razieh goes back to the examining magistrate’s
office.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE – DAY
Worried Razieh comes in. The examining magistrate is
writing something down. Nader is still standing in front of
him.
90
RAZIEH
(pleading)
Your honor, I beg you for the
sake of the Qoran and the
martyrs… he’s stressed out.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
I already wrote the order.
RAZIEH
In the past month, every other
day, he’s been in and out of
prison. His creditors have
deposited his checks. I’ve
begged them to let him come
out…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
I’ve been patient for the past
two days.
Razieh puts her hand in her bag and brings out a plastic
bag full of pills.
RAZIEH
I beg you to forgive him. Sir,
look at these. Every day he
takes a bunch of these. Ever
since he lost his job, he’s
been depressed. He can’t help
it.
NADER
Sir can I ask you to please
forgive him this time?
RAZIEH
(to the examining
magistrate)
You’re like his elder…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Go tell him to find someone to
vouch for you…
RAZIEH
Yes sir!
91
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
…and you don’t leave the
courthouse.
RAZIEH
I’ll wait for him to come back.
Razieh leaves the room.
EXT. COURTYARD – DAY
Termeh and Somayeh are seated next to the kitten in a
corner of the crowded courtyard. They are speaking to each
other.
TERMEH
It’s something the size of this
cat’s head.
SOMAYEH
Then how does it kick?
TERMEH
A four-month-old fetus kicks?!
SOMAYEH
Yes. I heard it!
TERMEH
A four-month-old-baby doesn’t
even have arms and legs, how
can it even kick?
SOMAYEH
Did you go into my mom’s… my
mom’s belly and see what it’s
like?
TERMEH
No but in books you can go and
see the pictures. It’s a piece
of meat like this…
She makes a face to look like an unformed fetus. Somayeh
laughs.
SOMAYEH
92
If it doesn’t have anything,
then how did they know it was a
boy?
TERMEH
Was it a boy?
SOMAYEH
After my mom gave birth to it
in the hospital, they found out
that it was a boy…
TERMEH
Did you see it too?
Hojjat is on his way out. He speaks to Somayeh. Upon
hearing Hojjat’s voice, Termeh does not continue her
conversation.
HOJJAT
Go sit next to your mother.
Don’t sit out in the sun.
Termeh sees Hojjat’s angry glance. Along with Somayeh, they
go inside. Hojjat walks towards the gate. Having gone after
the appraisal of the house, Simin walks in from the
opposite direction with documents in her hand. She walks
past Hojjat.
INT. CORRIDOR – EXT. COURTYARD – DAY
Nader and Termeh are sitting on a bench. His hand is still
handcuffed to the hand of an officer. Grandma Katti walks
in from the courtyard. She is kindly holding Somayeh’s
hand.
TERMEH
Will you tell her?
NADER
She’ll think it’s cause she
bailed me out.
TERMEH
So let her! Dad please!
NADER
93
(with no other
choice)
Okay…
TERMEH
You promise?
Jokingly, Nader raises his hand to swear. His hand is
handcuffed to the officer’s hand and raises his hand also.
NADER
(jokingly)
Why do you promise?
The officer laughs. Grandma Katti and Somayeh walk towards
Nader.
GRANDMA KATTI
Get up! Come and take back the
complaint you’ve filed against
them. Drop the complaint and
let them leave… poor things…
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE – DAY
Termeh and Nader get in their car and drive off.
TERMEH
Dad!
NADER
What is it?
TERMEH
You didn’t know Ms. Razieh was
pregnant?
NADER
No.
Another period of silence. Nader realizes that Termeh is
deep in thought.
NADER
Why do you ask?
TERMEH
It’s nothing.
94
NADER
Then why did you ask?
TERMEH
Last night mom said you knew.
NADER
Where was she to see if I knew?
TERMEH
She said when they told you at
the hospital that Razieh's baby
had died, you didn’t say
anything. You didn’t ask if she
was pregnant. You didn’t get
surprised. At times like this,
people usually ask if she was
carrying a child. It was like
you knew.
Nader is shocked at Termeh’s words. He stays quiet for a
moment.
NADER
Your mom wants to turn you
against me.
TERMEH
Don’t tell her I told you this.
Nader is still quiet. It is clear he is upset.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GRANDMA KATTI’S HOUSE – DAY
Nader’s car pulls over opposite Grandma Katti’s house. On
the other side, Simin and her mother get out of their car
and walk towards their house.
TERMEH
Will you tell her?
Nader is not sure how to respond to Termeh. He gets out and
walks to the other side of the street. Termeh stays in the
car. Nader walks across the street and reaches Grandma
Katti’s house. He rings the doorbell and enters. Termeh’s
anticipating gaze is at the door to Grandma Katti’s house.
(CONTINUED)
95
Her expression is that of worry. A few moments later,
Nader, walks out of the house holding his father’s arm.
Grandma Katti walks them to the door. Nader walks his
father across the street. He opens the rear passenger door
and helps his father into the back seat. Termeh’s hopeful
gaze is still at Grandma Katti’s house. Nader gets in and
when he turns the engine on and puts the car into gear, all
of Termeh’s hopes dissipate and upset, she turns her gaze
out of the window on her side. Nader realizes she is upset.
NADER
I can’t sweetie.
TERMEH
Didn’t you promise?
NADER
I’m sorry.
Nader drives off. A heavy silence falls between them in the
car.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – STAIRWAY – DAY
Nader is holding his father’s arm and is climbing the
stairs. Termeh who is still clearly upset, is climbing
ahead of them and has reached the door and is waiting for
her grandfather to reach her.
NADER
Which step had she fallen on?
TERMEH
That one down there.
Nader turns the key in the lock and opens the door. His
gaze is on the stairs and he is deep in thought.
NADER
Take him inside, I’ll be right
in.
Termeh takes her grandfather’s hand and takes him in. Nader
looks at the stairs.
INT. HALLWAY AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM – DAY
96
Termeh seats her grandfather on the edge of the bed. He is
quiet and helpless like a child. She goes back to the
hallway. Something is keeping her preoccupied. She sees
Somayeh’s backpack which has been left behind the apartment
door. She opens it and from it, she takes out a drawing and
looks at it. A childish drawing of a man and a woman. The
woman has a protruding belly. From the drawing it can be
perceived that the man and woman are fighting. Nader opens
the door and comes inside. He sees Termeh looking at the
drawing. Termeh takes the drawing to her room. Nader, tired
of the events of the past two days, takes off his jacket
and sinks into the sofa. His gaze is upon his father who is
clearly less energetic than the week before.
NADER
(to Termeh)
Sweetie will you put the kettle
on?
Without answering, Termeh walks into the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN – DAY
Frustrated with the stove’s broken lighter, Termeh lights
it with matches. Nader is standing in the kitchen doorway
and is looking at her.
NADER
What would you like for lunch?
I’ll order in.
TERMEH
I’m not hungry.
Nader walks into the kitchen.
NADER
Are you mad at me?
TERMEH
What did you go and say to Mrs.
Kalani?
NADER
What do you mean what did I
say?
TERMEH
97
Why did you go to their house?
NADER
I told her that they are coming
to investigate. To be aware. Is
that not okay?
TERMEH
If she is to tell the truth
then why should she be aware?
Nader is shocked at Termeh’s response. He realizes what she
means.
NADER
Come here. I want to show you
something.
TERMEH
I have homework to do.
NADER
Leave it. I’m telling you to
come.
Nader leaves the kitchen. With no other choice, Termeh
follows him.
INT. STAIRWAY – DAY
Nader opens the door to the apartment and walks towards the
stairs that lead downstairs. Termeh is perplexed and
standing in the doorway.
NADER
You said she had fallen down
here right?
Termeh is worried that the neighbors might hear them.
TERMEH
Okay come inside and explain.
NADER
I don’t want to say anything
bad. Okay… pretend that I am
that woman… I get thrown from
the door in this direction
right?
98
Nader moves from the door towards the step on which Razieh
had fallen. To reach that step, he has to change his
direction.
NADER
Come. Look. When someone is
thrown, they travel straight
ahead till they hit something.
They don’t turn one way and
then turn another way and then
come and fall here. Right? If I
had thrown her, she should have
fallen straight ahead on those
stairs up there or ultimately
on this first step. Okay
imagine that you’ve been
pushed, move in this direction…
Termeh is deep in thought.
TERMEH
Then how did she fall down
there?
NADER
I don’t know but she wasn’t
thrown on that step. Either she
fell on her own or something
happened to her afterwards.
Termeh is staring at the stairs. Nader goes towards the
apartment door.
NADER
You go and stand where I was
standing. Look from that spot.
Go and stand there.
Termeh goes and stands on the stairs leading downstairs
where Razieh had fallen.
TERMEH
(going down the
stairs)
Why don’t you tell them these
things?
99
NADER
(going inside the
house)
Forget them. I want you to
know. Look for yourself.
Nader goes inside and closes the door. Termeh is standing
in the stairway deep in thought.
INT. BEHIND THE APARTMENT DOOR AND HALLWAY – DAY
Nader is standing inside behind the apartment door. He too
is preoccupied. Before going out of the door, he sees his
father who is standing in the hallway and staring at him.
The two look at each other. Nader pushes down on the door
handle to open the door.
INT. STAIRWAY – DAY
The door to Nader’s house suddenly opens and Nader pushes a
young officer who is trying to keep from being pushed, out
towards the stairway. The young officer stops at the top of
the stairs.
NADER
(to the young
officer)
Sorry.
In the stairway, a police officer holding a piece of paper
witnesses this scene. The neighbors including Mrs. Kalani
are also standing in the stairway leading to the floor
above. Hojjat and Somayeh are standing in the landing of
the floor below and Razieh is standing in the middle of the
stairway.
POLICE OFFICER
(to Razieh)
Is that the direction he threw
you in?
RAZIEH
No, towards the lower floor.
NADER
100
Officer, this door doesn’t
allow anyone to be pushed
towards the lower floor.
POLICE OFFICER
Where did you fall down?
RAZIEH
On these stairs.
POLICE OFFICER
Which step?
Razieh doubtingly points out the second step down from
Nader’s floor. Hojjat is paying complete attention to
everything that is being said.
RAZIEH
I think it was this one.
POLICE OFFICER
You think or you’re sure?
RAZIEH
No I’m not sure.
POLICE OFFICER
(to Mrs. Kalani)
Is this where you found her?
MRS. KALANI
I didn’t see her fall but when
I arrived, she was sitting on
that step down there.
HOJJAT
(to Razieh)
Why aren’t you saying
anything?!... Go show them how
he pushed you.
RAZIEH
I was so upset that I didn’t
realize what was happening.
NADER
(to Hojjat)
101
Look, I’ll stand in her place
in he doorway.
(to the young
officer)
You push me out with all the
force you want to use. See if I
fall where this lady is saying
she fell.
HOJJAT
Of course you won’t fall. She
was a pregnant woman. She falls
with a touch.
NADER
Then you come and stand in your
wife’s place. You chose who
pushes you. See if you fall on
that step.
HOJJAT
What step?! She says she fell
on that step up there.
NADER
They all say they saw her on
that one down there.
POLICE OFFICER
(to the female
neighbor)
Ma’am did you see her get
thrown?
FEMALE NEIGHBOR
From up there I couldn’t see
the door but I saw the stairs
when she fell.
POLICE OFFICER
Can you show me from where you
saw?
The female neighbor, who is holding a child, goes up the
stairs. The police officer follows her.
NADER
Maybe she got dizzy and fell.
102
HOJJAT
(to Razieh)
How many times did you use
these stairs? Why hadn’t she
gotten dizzy before?
MRS. KALANI
Excuse me. That morning when I
saw her here I asked her why
there was garbage on the steps.
She said she had gotten dizzy
and dropped the bag.
(to Razieh)
Right?
RAZIEH
My daughter had taken the
garbage down.
MRS. KALANI
You told me you got dizzy…
NADER
Mrs. Kalani, hadn’t she mopped
the stairs that day? The stairs
were wet. Maybe she slipped and
fell.
HOJJAT
(angry)
Jerk! You pushed her and she
slipped.
NADER
Be respectful! I’m only not
saying anything to you in front
of your wife and kid.
HOJJAT
(angry)
You’ll eat shit before you say
anything!
POLICE OFFICER
(to Hojjat)
Don’t cuss. Take him outside.
103
HOJJAT
(to the police
officer)
They have to live with him.
Would they say anything against
him?
POLICE OFFICER
If you have evidence that
they’re lying then file a
complaint.
HOJJAT
So now they’re telling the
truth?
POLICE OFFICER
Take that up with your
examining magistrate.
The young officer guides Hojjat towards the stairs. Razieh
is helpless and she is standing halfway up the stairs and
looking at her husband who is being forced down the stairs
by the young officer. The sound of the neighbors going up
the stairs and explaining to the police officer and the
shouting and screaming by Hojjat exiting the building can
all be heard. Upset, Somayeh is looking at her mother.
INT. HALLWAY AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM – DAY
Somayeh is holding her backpack and is standing in the
doorway to the house. She is looking at Mr. Morteza who is
coming out of his room. Nader brings Somayeh her drawing
book.
NADER
Come here… don’t you want you
drawing book? Honey don’t get
upset at you parents’ and I
fighting okay? Here… come here
let me put this in your
backpack.
SOMAYEH
My mom didn’t take any money.
NADER
104
I know… that’s not why we
fought.
SOMAYEH
Then why did you fight?
NADER
Cause I got upset that she left
my dad.
SOMAYEH
She had gone to the doctor.
Nader is surprised at Somayeh’s words and thinks.
NADER
Ok honey. Go on… be careful
going down the stairs.
INT. MEDICAL EXAMINER’S OFFICE – EXAMINATION ROOM – DAY
Mr. Morteza is sitting on the examination chair and a
middle-aged doctor is reading the piece of paper that Nader
has brought form the courthouse. Nader is standing opposite
his desk.
MEDICAL EXAMINER
Based on the court’s request,
we’ll examine him and write our
observations.
NADER
But you are seeing that he
can’t talk.
MEDICAL EXAMINER
Didn’t you say he has
Alzheimer’s?
NADER
Yes but he used to say some
things.
MEDICAL EXAMINER
This is not a courthouse. These
things you have to prove over
there.
105
Nader is upset at hearing the examiner’s response.
MEDICAL EXAMINER
Has he sustained any physical
harm?
NADER
Yes he has bruises…
MEDICAL EXAMINER
Lay him down on the bed, take
off his clothes.
Nader walks his father towards the bed and lays him down.
He unbuttons his shirt. He untucks his shirt, he thinks for
a moment, he changes his mind, puts his father’s shirt back
on and buttons it up. The doctor walks towards them.
MEDICAL EXMAINER
What happened?
NADER
I’m not sure his bruises are
from when he fell off the bed.
EXT. OUTSIDE TERMEH’S SCHOOL – DAY
Simin is behind the wheel and is waiting for Termeh to come
out of her school. The students are all happy and noisy.
They’ve just given their exams and leaving the school and
walking towards their parents or their rides home. Termeh
comes out of her school. She is looking for her father’s
car in the street. Simin sees her and honks. Termeh sees
her and quickly rushes towards her mother’s car.
SIMIN
Don’t run… slow down.
Termeh is worried and from the window speaks to her mother.
TERMEH
Mom there’s a fight.
INT. CORRIDOR – DAY
The sounds of an argument and fight are heard from the
headmistress’s office. Simin and Termeh quickly walk
106
towards the headmistress’s office. Several of the school
children are curious to see what’s going on and are
standing in the corridor. Termeh, embarrassed by this
situation, waits outside the office and Simin enters.
INT. HEDMISTRESS’S OFFICE – DAY
A large office with windows facing the courtyard. Mrs.
Ghahraei is very scared and is pale. She is standing in a
corner. The HEADMISTRESS, VICE-PRINCIPAL and one or two of
the staff are also there. Hojjat, upset and distraught, is
sitting on a chair. He is holding a Qoran in his hand. The
school JANITOR is standing next to him. It is clear that
prior to Simin’s arrival, a huge argument has taken place.
VICE-PRINCIPAL
(to Hojjat)
You have a fight, take it to
the police.
HOJJAT
I don’t want to fight with
anyone. I just want to speak to
this lady.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
(trembling)
What do I have to say to you? I
don’t know you nor this woman’s
husband.
HOJJAT
If you don’t know him, then why
did you come to the courthouse
and lie?
SIMIN
What lie did she tell?
HOJJAT
She knows what she said.
HEADMISTRESS
Ms. Safaei, call the police.
HOJJAT
Ma’am, don’t scare me with the
police.
107
JANITOR
This isn’t right sir… please
get up and leave.
SIMIN
Your fight is with someone
else, not with her…
HOJJAT
If it's not with her, then why
does she try to get my daughter
to speak?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
I did no such thing.
HOJJAT
Why did you tell her I hit her
mom and she lost the baby?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
When did I say such a thing?!
HOJJAT
You are a teacher for god’s
sake. Aren’t you ashamed? You
pick on a 4-year-old’s drawing
and tell her her dad hit her
mom and she lost the baby? Is
that the reason?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
I didn’t say it like that.
HOJJAT
Why is it that you think my
kind beats our wives and
children like animals. I swear
on this Qoran, we’re humans
just like you.
Hojjat’s hands are shaking with anger. There’s a moment of
silence and everyone is upset about his situation.
JANITOR
Let’s go outside and get some
fresh air. Come on.
108
Hojjat gets up to leave. On is way out he gives Simin an
ultimatum.
HOJJAT
I have nothing else left to
lose. Not even my life.
He pushes his collar aside and shows them his neck.
PRINCIPAL
Okay sir, leave.
HOJJAT
(to Mrs. Ghahraei)
Ma’am, I’m not going to let you
go. I’m unemployed. I’ll stand
out there all day. Eventually
you’ll come out. Come to court
and say you lied or I’ll get to
the bottom of what’s between
you and her husband…
MRS. GHAHRAEI
(yelling)
Shame on you! What do you mean
between you?! I keep quiet and
you…
HOJJAT
If there’s nothing why do you
help him?
MRS. GHAHRAEI
It was YOU who called and said
come to court they have a
question for you. I came there
and whatever they asked, I told
them the truth.
HOJJAT
If you say you said the truth
then place your hand on this
and swear.
SIMIN
Sir…
109
MRS. GHAHRAEI
(yelling)
Fine give me that Qoran! I’m
not scared.
HOJJAT
You said her husband didn’t
know my wife was pregnant. Say
that!
Mrs. Ghahraei comes forward and places her hand on the
Qoran that Hojjat has brought with him.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
(yelling)
I swear on this Qoran that day
at their house, her husband
didn’t hear what your wife and
I said. He was in the kitchen
and didn’t find out that your
wife was pregnant from our
conversation… Okay? Anything
else I should say?
Hojjat leaves. Simin is upset and is standing in a corner.
The vice-principal seats Mrs. Ghahraei, who is still
shaking from fear, down on a chair.
HEADMISTRESS
He’s crazy…
(to Mrs. Ghahraei)
Don’t leave on your own. Call
your husband to come here.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
No… no… I don’t want him to
find out.
SIMIN
I’m sorry Mrs. Ghahraei.
MRS. GHAHRAEI
I only went to court out of
respect for your husband… If
I’d know it would come to this,
I wouldn’t have even answered
my phone.
110
Mrs. Ghahraei gets up to leave.
VICE-PRINCIPAL
Where to? He hasn’t left yet!
MRS. GHAHRAEI
I’m going to wash my face.
Mrs. Ghahraei leaves the office.
INT. CORRIDOR – DAY (CONT.)
Termeh is behind the office door and it is clear that she
has heard everything. Mrs. Ghahraei comes out of the office
and Termeh sees her angry and upset glare. She is ashamed.
Mrs. Ghahraei leaves. Upset, Termeh walks towards the exit.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – HALLWAY – DAY
Nader has the receiver to his ear and is waiting for the
other end to pick up. He walks through the hallway to the
door and opens it for Simin and Termeh and then walks back
to the living room.
NADER
Hello? Hello Mrs. Ghahraei. I
left you a message earlier. Can
you please pick up?
(pause)
The lady that took care of my
dad, apparently that day you
gave her the number for a
gynecologist. I wanted to ask
you for that number to call and
see if she went to see the
doctor that week and what her
problem was. I would appreciate
you calling me back. Thank you.
INT. KITCHEN – DAY
Nader places the tray and dishes in the kitchen sink. He
does not pay any attention to Simin. Worried, Termeh comes
to the kitchen door.
SIMIN
What do you want to do?
111
NADER
With what?
SIMIN
With them.
NADER
What do you mean?
SIMIN
You want to have fights and
arguments everyday?
NADER
Why what’s happened?
SIMIN
He’s gone to her school today
and embarrassed her in front of
everyone.
NADER
(to Termeh)
What did he say?
TERMEH
He screamed, “Her dad killed my
child.”
SIMIN
How can she go back to that
school?
Nader is upset at hearing this.
SIMIN
Do you know what you are doing?
NADER
What I’m doing?
SIMIN
He’s making threats.
NADER
He wouldn't dare!
112
SIMIN
Termeh honey go to your room
and close the door.
Reluctantly, Termeh leaves the kitchen and closes the door.
SIMIN
What if he kills your child on
her way to school?
NADER
What would you have me do? Run
off abroad with you?
SIMIN
To hell with abroad! I’m
talking to you about my child.
What is this situation you’ve
created for her?
NADER
I created? You have some nerve
accusing me? Who left home? Who
filed for a divorce in the
middle of her exams?
SIMIN
Didn’t you say leave whenever
you want?!
NADER
Yes. Why did you come back?
Leave!
SIMIN
I will! But first I’m going to
see about her situation.
NADER
Her situation’s fine.
SIMIN
You have two choices…
NADER
Don’t give me an ultimatum.
113
SIMIN
It’s not an ultimatum. Either
you clear up the situation with
them…
NADER
No I know what to do with them.
SIMIN
Didn’t you hit her? Didn’t you
throw her on the stairs? Didn’t
she lose her baby?
NADER
(sarcastically)
Yes! Yes! I killed her child!
SIMIN
So then why are you being
stubborn? Pay the blood money
and end it.
NADER
I won’t be forced into paying.
SIMIN
Why forced? Put yourself in
their place.
NADER
I’m not responsible for their
troubles.
SIMIN
(yelling)
Their child died!
NADER
(yelling)
And my dad has been hurt! He
doesn’t even speak anymore!
SIMIN
He didn’t speak much before.
NADER
114
I was happy with the few words
he spoke.
SIMIN
You’re comparing this with you
causing her miscarriage?
NADER
Where were you to see I caused
it?
SIMIN
Then how did she lose it?
NADER
(losing his
temper)
I don’t know. There might be a
chance that her husband did
something and now she wants to
blame me. Her child said that
she had gone to the doctor that
day. What had happened that she
couldn’t wait 2 hours to go to
the doctor? Why did she tie the
old man to his bed and leave?
SIMIN
The medical examiner said her
child died due to a blow!
NADER
The medical examiner is not
God! I won’t accept that I did
it till it’s been proven to me.
SIMIN
Fine let me take Termeh.
NADER
Shame on you for trying to put
pressure on me in this
situation.
SIMIN
I’m worried about my child.
NADER
115
Your child wants to live here
in this society. She has to
stay here and learn.
SIMIN
Learn what? Fighting and
stubbornness?
NADER
I don’t want her to learn from
you and be a coward and afraid
every time someone screams. He
knows where to come to scream.
Why doesn’t he come and
threaten me?
SIMIN
Yes I’m a coward.
NADER
Your whole life, instead of
solving problems, you’ve either
run away or held your hands up
and given in. Just say why you
want to leave this country.
You’re afraid to stay.
SIMIN
Oh and you’re staying to fix
the country? You couldn’t even
manage this house for one week
without me.
NADER
I couldn’t manage it and I’m
responsible.
SIMIN
Fine, let me take Termeh and
you do what you want.
NADER
I haven’t stopped her from
leaving.
Nader walks towards the door. He opens it and speaks to
Termeh in the living room.
116
NADER
Termeh sweetie, don’t feel like
you have to stay. Go wherever
you like.
Upset, Simin leaves the kitchen.
INT. LIVING ROOM AND THE CORRIDOR – DAY (CONT.)
Termeh is seated on a sofa and is thinking about all the
things she’s just heard. Simin comes out of the kitchen and
walks into the living room. She takes her purse from the
sofa.
SIMIN
You still don’t want to come?!
Termeh does not respond. She does not even raise her head.
Simin walks towards the door and leaves the house.
INT. TERMEH’S ROOM – DAY
Nader is busy working with Termeh on her math homework.
NADER
He sells it for 200 tomans a
kilo. If he uses 270 kilograms
of flour a day… write down 270…
how much is his daily income?
Meaning how much profit does he
earn a day? So how do we
calculate this?
TERMEH
Did you lie?
Nader is shocked at hearing Termeh say this.
NADER
What?
TERMEH
You lied.
NADER
About what?
TERMEH
117
That you said you didn’t know
Ms. Razieh was pregnant.
NADER
Why do you ask?
TERMEH
You said you didn’t hear Razieh
speak to Mrs. Ghahraei that
day.
NADER
That’s right.
TERMEH
Then how did you know that Mrs.
Ghahraei gave her the number
for the gynecologist? Isn’t
that when she gave it to her?
Nader is shocked at Termeh’s question and wasn’t expecting
it. He doesn’t know what to say. He doesn’t know what
answer to give Termeh.
NADER
All right… if we want to
calculate the profit…
Nader falls silent for a moment.
NADER
Your mom was telling the truth…
I knew she was pregnant.
Termeh raises her head. She is shocked at what her father
has just said.
NADER
When they were talking in the
living room, I heard everything
from the kitchen.
TERMEH
Then why did you say you
didn’t?
NADER
118
Do you know what would happen
if I’d said I knew? One to
three years in prison. I only
thought of what would happen to
you. Who would you stay with…
Termeh doesn’t know what to do.
TERMEH
If you knew, why did you hit
her?
NADER
I knew she was pregnant but at
that moment I didn’t. I had
forgotten it. I wasn't paying
attention. I don’t know what it
was.
TERMEH
So explain this to them.
NADER
The law doesn’t care about
this. Either I knew or I
didn’t…
Termeh thinks about what her father has just said.
NADER
If you want me to I’ll go and
tell them…
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE TERMEH’S SCHOOL – NADER’S CAR – DAY
Nader is sitting behind the wheel of his car and his father
is in the front side passenger seat. His car reaches the
street on which Termeh’s school is. As he turns into the
street, he sees Hojjat who is standing by his motorcycle.
Worried, Nader stops in front of the school. As he is
watching Hojjat in his rearview mirror, the students are
leaving the school. Nader notices that several of the
students are looking at him. He understands the meaning of
their look. Termeh walks through the school gate. Nader’s
gaze follows her to his car and in the rearview mirror he
is watching to make sure that Hojjat will not do anything.
Termeh opens the rear passenger door.
119
TERMEH
Hi.
NADER
Hi sweetie.
TERMEH
Didn’t I ask you to not come to
the front?
Nader is hurt by what Termeh has just said. He has no
response to her comment. He backs up to make a U-turn. He
spots Mrs. Ghahraei’s car passing them on the street. He
honks for her to stop. Mrs. Ghahraei keeps driving. Nader
gets out.
NADER
Mrs. Ghahraei… Mrs. Ghahraei!
Mrs. Ghahraei’s car speeds away. Nader gets in and quickly
changes his direction and follows her.
TERMEH
What do you want with her?
Nader does not answer and speeds up.
INT. COURTHOUSE - EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE – DAY
Nader is standing opposite the examining magistrate’s desk.
He is writing down his complaint. Standing in the doorway
are several plaintiffs and accused who are all waiting to
see the examining magistrate.
NADER
Who’s responsible for my
child’s safety now?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Without a witness there's no
case.
NADER
So without a witness I should
wait for him to kill her and
then come to you?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
120
How should I know you are
telling the truth?
NADER
Why should I lie? Bring my
daughter and father here just
to lie?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Is she here now?
NADER
Yes outside. Ask her yourself.
I'm afraid to leave her at
school. I'm afraid to leave my
dad at home. I can’t go to
work. My life is a mess. I
can’t go to work…
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
You didn’t know his wife was
pregnant?
NADER
No I didn’t.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
When she was speaking to your
daughter’s teacher you didn’t
hear them?
NADER
No I didn’t.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
You didn’t huh?
NADER
No.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
You daughter’s teacher came
here and revoked her testimony.
She says you knew.
NADER
She came here and said I knew?
121
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Yes she came yesterday.
NADER
Cause he went to the school and
threatened her.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Answer me. Did you hear her or
not?
NADER
No I didn’t hear them.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Then how did you know she gave
her the doctor’s number?
NADER
My daughter told me.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
What did your daughter say?
NADER
She said that this woman got
the number for a gynecologist
from her teacher.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Go tell your daughter to come
in… and wait outside.
With no other choice, Nader goes out of the room. Other
plaintiffs and the accused come in with their files as soon
as Nader leaves.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE AND CORRIDOR – DAY
Nader’s mind is preoccupied. He passes through the
manager’s office and enters the corridor. He walks towards
Mr. Morteza and Termeh who are seated next to each other on
a bench in the middle of the busy waiting area. Termeh is
in her school uniform and has her schoolbag with her. She
has a book in her hand though she is not reading it and is
looking at a cat wandering through the corridor. Nader
walks towards her.
122
NADER
Termeh… honey get up and come.
Termeh leaves her bag and book and walks towards Nader.
NADER
Go in. He wants to ask you some
questions.
TERMEH
What questions?
Nader doesn’t know how to answer Termeh’s question.
TERMEH
What does he want to ask?
NADER
I don’t know.
Nader walks towards the examining magistrate’s manager’s
office. Termeh follows him. They are both worried. Mr.
Morteza is left sitting by himself. Termeh goes into the
room and Nader goes back and sits next to his father. He is
worried and waiting for Termeh to come back.
INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S ROOM – DAY
It is clear that Termeh has walked in while another file is
being handled. The accused are handcuffed and seated.
Termeh is standing next to the examining magistrate’s desk.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
So what do you have to say?
TERMEH
You haven’t asked me anything
yet?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Didn’t your dad tell you what I
want to ask you?
TERMEH
No.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
123
What grade are you in school?
TERMEH
Sixth.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
And that day when your teacher
came to your house and asked
your housekeeper about her
pregnancy where you there?
TERMEH
Not then, I had gone to get my
books.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Then how did you know she got
the doctor’s number from your
teacher?
TERMEH
Cause she gave her the number
afterwards, when she was
leaving.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
She gave it to her in front of
you?
TERMEH
Yes.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Why didn’t you tell your dad
sooner?
TERMEH
What?
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
That she got the doctor’s
number from your teacher.
TERMEH
I didn’t think it was important
for my dad to know.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
124
And did you tell your dad or
did he hear it?
TERMEH
When she gave the number… I
told him.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
You told him?
TERMEH
Yes.
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
Okay.
EXT. AND INT. NADER’S CAR – STREET – DAY
Nader is behind the wheel and is driving. His father is in
the front passenger side seat and Termeh is sitting in the
back. Termeh is upset and looking out of the window. Nader
notices that she is upset. Termeh is quiet. Nader pulls
over. All three are sitting quietly in the car and Nader is
upset about the turn of events.
EXT. TEHRAN BAZAAR – INT. COBBLER’S BLOCK – DAY
Simin and Azam, Razieh’s sister-in-law, are walking in the
cobbler’s block at the Tehran Bazaar. The bazaar is busy
and they turn into one of its many arcades.
INT. COBBLER’S WORKSHOP – DAY
Azam, Simin and Hojjat are sitting on stools in the middle
of a cobbler’s workshop, which seems to have been closed
for a long time. All the necessary tools and materials are
there but no one is at work. Mr. Ali, an old man who seems
to be the owner is sitting behind an old and faded desk
next to a noisy window. His head is resting on the desk and
he has fallen asleep.
SIMIN
(to Hojjat)
I’m afraid of something worse
happening because of all these
arguments.
AZAM
125
Ma’am it’s your husband who is
hurting this poor soul.
SIMIN
They’re both being stubborn.
HOJJAT
How’ve I been unfair? What
crime have I committed? Was it
anything other than the fact
that my wife was beaten and my
child died?
SIMIN
You’re right.
HOJJAT
Your husband is not taking
responsibility.
SIMIN
I admit that he’s to blame but
what’ll all this lead to? One
or two years in court for a
payment plan for the blood
money.
HOJJAT
That’s what upsets me. Ma’am,
why do you think it’s for the
money that I am going to court?
SIMIN
When did I say such a thing?
HOJJAT
I know you think this guy is a
poor bum who is a con and now
that his kid has died he wants
to…
SIMIN
Why do you have to say such…
HOJJAT
I know it! We’re a bunch of
people with no honor…
126
AZAM
Let’s hear what she has to say.
Mr. Ali, who had fallen asleep behind the desk, wakes up by
the noise and gets up to get some water from the cooler.
SIMIN
There’s no other way. Your
child won't come back to life
and my husband won't get hanged
for this.
AZAM
She’s right. And besides it’s
not like her husband did this
on purpose.
Upset, Hojjat stands up to leave. Mr. Ali follows him.
MR. ALI
They’re good people for giving
you a solution. Take the money
and settle it. You can use it
in your situation. End this
ordeal.
SIMIN
We’ll decide on an amount right
now and I’ll get my husband’s
approval.
Hojjat walks towards the door.
HOJJAT
Now we have to get his
approval?
MR. ALI
You act like you don’t need the
money. Take a look at yourself.
Hojjat gets upset and goes out of the workshop.
AZAM
Mr. Ali, don’t let him leave.
Mr. Ali follows Hojjat out of the shop.
127
MR. ALI
(on his way out)
So stubborn!
Simin is looking at them. Mr. Ali, who has followed Hojjat,
reaches him, stops him and begins talking to him.
INT. NADER’S HOUSE – TERMEH’S ROOM – AFTERNOON
Simin is sitting on the edge of the bed. She is alone in
the house. She is staring at the balcony and the clothing,
which are on the clothes drier and gently moving in the
breeze. She hears the sound of the key being turned in the
lock and Nader, Termeh and Mr. Morteza all enter. Simin
stands up. She sees her own reflection in the mirror and
tries to conceal the sorrow she feels. She is not sure
whether to leave the room or wait for Nader and Termeh to
come in. Termeh realizes Simin is there and comes to the
doorway. Without saying anything, Simin hugs her.
TERMEH
Will you stay?
Simin doesn’t know what to say.
TERMEH
Mom!
SIMIN
Let me speak to him.
INT. KITCHEN – AFTERNOON
Nader is busy placing the dirty dishes in the dishwasher.
He is frustrated by how all the dishes won’t fit. Simin
comes into the kitchen and stands next to the balcony.
Nader does not acknowledge her presence. Simin doesn’t know
where to start.
SIMIN
Come and sit. I want to talk to
you.
NADER
I can hear you.
SIMIN
128
I went and spoke to her husband
today.
Nader is still busy with the dishes.
SIMIN
Leave those for a minute.
Nader closes the dishwasher door and faces Simin.
SIMIN
It was difficult but I managed
to get him to agree to take
fifteen-million instead of
forty. Three five-million toman
checks in exchange for his
consent.
NADER
(shocked)
With whose permission did you
promise him money?!
SIMIN
I can’t handle the stress of my
child’s safety. Just now when
you were late, I was dying with
worry.
NADER
You didn’t get what I just
said. I’m saying why are you
interfering?
SIMIN
I didn’t come here to fight.
NADER
(frustrated)
Oh God why can’t I make her
understand?
SIMIN
Didn’t you say it was my fault,
that I introduced her for the
job, that if I hadn’t left none
of this would’ve happened? So
let me fix it.
129
NADER
If I pay them, it means I have
accepted that it was my fault.
He’ll never leave us alone.
SIMIN
Do you think he will if you
don’t pay?
NADER
Why should I bribe someone who…
SIMIN
Pretend it’s my dower that
you’re paying.
NADER
I would beg and borrow to pay
you your dower but extortion, I
neither have the money for nor
will I pay it.
SIMIN
Our child is going through
adolescence. She is suffering.
NADER
If she were suffering she
wouldn’t have stayed.
SIMIN
Why do you think she has
stayed? Chosen you? To keep us
from separating. She knows I
won’t go anywhere without her.
She is suffering but she will
not show it.
NADER
You’ll call them right now and
say that my husband says I
won’t pay until it’s been
proven to me that I am
responsible.
SIMIN
I’ll sell my car.
130
NADER
I don’t want you to sell your
car for my sake.
SIMIN
When your child is not
important enough for you to pay
fifteen million…
NADER
Why are you talking nonsense?
Money’s not the issue. I won’t
give in till it’s been proven
to me that it was my fault.
SIMIN
As long as my child’s safety is
not guaranteed, I won’t…
NADER
You don’t have the right to do
anything…
SIMIN
If I hadn’t done anything you’d
still be in jail.
NADER
I don’t want to be out because
of your mom’s deed. Come to
court on Monday and get it
back.
Nader tries to control himself and to not lose his temper.
Simin leaves the kitchen and is angry.
INT. LIVING ROOM AND CORRIDOR – AFTERNOON (CONT’D)
Termeh is sitting on a sofa close to the kitchen. Mr.
Morteza has sensed the fighting and has come out of his
room and walks towards the kitchen. Simin walks from the
kitchen to Termeh’s room. Mr. Morteza follows her.
SIMIN
(walking and
speaking loudly,
(MORE)
131
to Nader)
Just say my child isn’t worth
fifteen million for me and cut
it out with the excuses.
Nader comes out of the kitchen. He takes his father’s hand
and walks him towards the bathroom.
SIMIN
(walking towards
Termeh)
Get up! I won’t let you stay
here anymore. It is dangerous.
Nader takes his father into the bathroom. He stands in the
doorway to the bathroom and looks at Termeh. Termeh doesn’t
know what to do. Simin comes out of Termeh’s room with her
things. Termeh stands up. Nader is watching her.
TERMEH
You said you’d stay.
SIMIN
(screaming)
I was stupid… get up!
TERMEH
Fine… you go downstairs and
I’ll come too.
Simin takes her keys and leaves the house. She is angry.
Termeh is sad and walks towards her room. She passes Nader
on her way.
NADER
Don’t worry daddy. Go there for
a few days till your exams are
over. You’ll be with grandma.
You’ll have more fun.
TERMEH
Didn’t you say it’s not
serious?
NADER
It got serious.
132
Termeh, who is not expecting to hear this, is suddenly
overwhelmed and starts to cry. She walks towards her room.
Nader leaves his father and follows her.
NADER
Termeh… Termeh… sweetheart!
Termeh pays no attention to him and walks towards her room.
NADER
If you cry, I’ll cry too.
TERMEH
Why won’t you pay them so that
mom will come back?
NADER
Mom’s coming back has nothing
to do with this.
TERMEH
It does. She had come to stay.
Her stuff was in the car. I saw
them.
Termeh goes inside her room and closes the door. The
constant sound of the intercom can be heard. Nader comes
back to the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN, HALLWAY – EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE – AFTERNOON
Nader is upset and conflicted. He is in the kitchen next to
the balcony and is looking downstairs in the street. He
sees Simin’s car parked across the street. The apartment
door opens. He looks towards the door. Termeh has opened
the door to leave. Mr. Morteza has walked to the door with
her as if to stop her. Termeh leaves her things outside the
door and brings Mr. Morteza back inside. Nader is still
conflicted and walks to the kitchen door. Termeh again
walks to the apartment door and picks up her things.
NADER
Termeh…
Termeh stops to listen to what Nader has to say.
NADER (CONT’D)
133
…if you think I am guilty go
tell your mom to come back
upstairs. We’ll call them to
arrange a meeting to pay them.
The intercom rings again. Termeh leaves. Nader goes back to
the balcony. He looks down at the street and sees Simin who
walks back to her car and gets in. He waits to see if
Termeh leaves with her mother or stays. Moments later,
Termeh gets into her mother’s car and they drive away.
Nader seems to be happy that Termeh has not asked her
mother to come back upstairs. He leaves the kitchen.
INT. LANGUAGE INSTITUTE, STAIRWAY AND CORRIDOR – DAY
Razieh and her daughter come up the stairs of a language
institute. They enter the institute. All around the
reception are classrooms filled with young men and women
learning English. The doors to some of the classes are
open. Razieh walks in and walks towards the receptionist’s
desk.
RAZIEH
Hello… excuse me is Ms. Rafiee
here?
RECEPTIONIST
She’s teaching.
RAZIEH
She told me to come at ten.
RECEPTIONIST
Please take a seat.
Razieh and her little girl sit and wait.
INT. CLASSROOM – DAY
Razieh and Simin are seated on two chairs and are facing
each other. They are surrounded by empty chairs. A few
away, Somayeh is drawing on the blackboard. Razieh is
struggling with what she wants to say.
RAZIEH
I have doubts.
SIMIN
134
(shocked)
Didn’t he throw you?
RAZIEH
Yes…
Razieh falls silent.
SIMIN
Did something happen afterwards
at home?
RAZIEH
No. Even before that my child
wasn’t moving.
SIMIN
Before when?
RAZIEH
Before he pushed me.
SIMIN
You mean your child had already
died?
RAZEIH
I don’t know. Maybe.
Simin is shocked and is quiet. Razieh is worried and looks
at Somayeh.
SIMIN
Had something happened before
it?
RAZIEH
I’m not sure but the night
before I had pain.
SIMIN
Why?
RAZIEH
I was hit by a car.
Simin is extremely shocked at what she has just heard. They
are both silent.
135
RAZIEH
You father-in-law had wandered
into the street. I went after
him. He was crossing the street
to come back. I ran to stop him
from getting hit by a car but I
got hit instead. The pain
started that night.
SIMIN
Does your husband know this?
Razieh is quiet.
SIMIN
Why don’t you come say this in
court?
RAZIEH
Since yesterday when you told
him about this money, he’s
promised it to his creditors.
SIMIN
What’s that got to do with my
husband? Come see what’s
happened to our life!
RAZIEH
It's my fault. Yesterday when
he said you’ve promised him
this money, I got really
scared. I called a few people.
They all say if I have doubts
then it’s a sin to take it.
SIMIN
If we don’t want to pay this
money we have to prove that my
husband is innocent.
RAZIEH
No please! I made you swear
that none of this would leave
this room.
SIMIN
136
But your husband won’t leave us
alone. I fear for my child.
RAZIEH
I’m afraid of dirty money
coming into my life and
something bad happening to my
child.
SIMIN
What do you suggest we do?
RAZIEH
Don’t pay this money.
SIMIN
Your husband won’t leave us
alone.
Razieh has no response to this. Simin feels sorry for her
helplessness. They are both quiet and Somayeh is busy
drawing on the blackboard.
INT. HOJJAT’S HOUSE, KITCHEN AND HALLWAY – NIGHT
Hojjat’s house is small but clean with white walls. Razieh
is busy in the tiny kitchen. She is pouring tea in glasses
set on a tray. She is anxious and is trying to conceal her
worry. Through the door she can see her small hallway where
Somayeh and Termeh are seated next to each other. Somayeh
shows her drawing to Termeh. She is happy that Termeh has
come to their house. Razieh takes the tray and walks to the
hallway. In the hallway, she comes face-to-face with Azam
her sister-in-law who has come out of the living room.
AZAM
Give me that. Bring some
plates.
Razieh gives her the tea tray. Azam sees that Razieh is
worried.
AZAM
Don’t be afraid. Nothing will
happen.
Razieh goes back into the kitchen.
137
INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
The living room of this small house consists of two
interconnected rooms. Blankets have been spread all around
the edge of the room for guests to sit on. Nader and Simin
are seated on one side of the room and Hojjat is seated on
the opposite side. A few middle-aged men who are Hojjat’s
creditors and acquaintances are also in the room. Azam
offers tea to everyone and then sits in a corner.
SIMIN
(to Hojjat)
Tomorrow or the day after…
whenever you revoke your
complaint, we’ll give you three
checks.
MIDDLE-AGED MAN #1
God bless you.
MIDDLE-AGED MAN #2
Hojjat get a pen and paper so
we can write everything down
and sign it so that…
NADER
Before we do, I just want to
say something…
MIDDLE-AGED MAN #3
Say a prayer. Whatever it was,
it’s finished now.
NADER
No I have already agreed and
will honor my word. I just want
his wife and my daughter to be
here when I speak.
HOJJAT
(to Azam)
Why doesn’t she come?
AZAM
(facing the
hallway and
calling Razieh)
Sister…
138
NADER
Would you please also call my
daughter?
AZAM
Young lady… your father wants
you.
Everyone is quiet and curious to know what Nader wants to
say. Termeh comes in. Nader moves over a little so that she
can sit next to him. Razieh and her daughter also come in
and sit by the door.
RAZIEH
(to everyone)
Excuse me.
NADER
Look, before I write the
checks, I have a favor to ask
of you. Ma’am you are a devout
person. Please bring a Qoran
and place your hand on it and
swear that I caused your
miscarriage.
Razieh is shocked at hearing Nader say this. Simin who was
not expecting such a request is worried.
MIDDLE-AGED MAN
Go bring a Qoran.
HOJJAT
(to Azam)
Go get it.
Before Azam can get up, Razieh stands up and leaves the
room.
INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT
Razieh is frustrated and is standing in their small kitchen
and is deeply conflicted. She doesn’t know what to do.
Worried, Azam comes to the doorway holding a Qoran.
AZAM
139
Come back quick or they’ll
suspect something.
Razieh is stressed and is looking at her.
AZAM
His creditors are here for the
money. For the martyrs’ sake,
don’t ruin our reputation.
RAZIEH
I won’t swear.
Azam is wondering how to convince her to go back. Hojjat
walks in not knowing what’s happening.
HOJJAT
Why aren’t you coming?
Razieh is afraid to answer.
AZAM
She’s afraid to swear.
Hojjat looks at Razieh in disbelief.
RAZIEH
I have doubts.
Upon hearing this, Hojjat panics. He closes the kitchen
door so that they are not heard. Azam stays out of the
kitchen.
HOJJAT
(panicking)
Why are you saying this now?!
RAZIEH
I had told Azam.
HOJJAT
(frustrated)
Why don’t you tell me exactly
what happened?!
RAZIEH
The day before it, a car hit me
and that night I had a lot of
pain.
140
Hojjat is thinking of what to do.
HOJJAT
It'll be my sin.
RAZIEH
No. It's a sin. I asked.
HOJJAT
They’ve consented to pay it.
RAZIEH
I am scared that we’ll be
punished.
HOJJAT
(tense)
More punished than this?
(pleading)
Take a look at my situation.
Have mercy on me.
RAZIEH
I’m afraid of something bad
happening to our child.
HOJJAT
But you’re the one being cruel
to her now.
Hojjat approaches Razieh pleadingly to take her out of the
kitchen. His behavior is not normal.
RAZIEH
I swear to God I can’t!
Suddenly Hojjat starts to quietly beat himself like a
madman. Razieh tries to hold his hands. Hojjat has lost all
control. He is angry and leaves the kitchen. Worried,
Razieh leaves the kitchen after him.
INT. HALLWAY AND LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
Hojjat leaves. Upset, Razieh passes through the hallway and
walks to the living room where Nader, Simin, Termeh and the
rest of the guests are sitting. In the doorway she faces
Simin and speaks.
141
RAZIEH
Ma’am why did you come here
tonight? Didn’t I tell you not
to come? Didn’t I tell you this
money is dirty I don’t want it?
Why did you do this to me? How
will I live in this house? I
swear to God, I will never
forgive you!
In tears, Razieh leaves the room. Nader looks at Simin in
disbelief. Somayeh and Termeh are quietly staring at each
other.
EXT. OUTSIDE HOJJAT’S HOUSE – NIGHT
Nader’s car is parked in an open area close to the street
where Hojjat’s house is located. All the car windows are
broken or shattered. Nader, Simin and Termeh have reached
their car and are shocked at seeing this scene. Upset,
Nader opens the car door and removes the shattered glass
from the seats. A piece of glass cuts his hand. He wraps a
tissue around his bleeding hand and gets in.
INT. NADER’S CAR, EXT. STREET – NIGHT
Nader’s car moves through the streets of the southern part
of the city. Through the glassless windows, the wind blows
through the car. They keep driving and Termeh is deep in
thought.
INT. FAMILY COURT, COURTROOM – DAY
It is the following season. From the view outside the
window it is clear that the weather is cloudy and it is
raining. Nader and Simin are seated on two chairs facing
the judge. They are dressed head to toe in black winter
clothing. It is clear from the length of Nader’s beard that
he has not shaved it for a few months. They are both quiet
and the judge is reading their petition. A few moments of
peace and quiet ensue.
INT. CORRIDOR – DAY
Termeh is sitting alone in the busy corridor. She is
wearing a black cardigan over her school uniform for the
(CONTINUED)
142
new school term. She is deep in thought. Nader comes and
takes her into the judge’s room. Termeh stands in front of
the judge. Her parents are on either side. Nader is
standing and Simin is still sitting.
TERMEH
Hello.
JUDGE
Hello. So young lady, your
parents have left it up to you
to decide whom you want to live
with.
Termeh is struggling to answer.
JUDGE
Have you decided?
Nader and Simin are trying to pretend to be calm but are
both worried about her answer.
JUDGE
So what is it?
TERMEH
Do I have to say it now?
JUDGE
If you haven’t decided…
TERMEH
Yes I have.
JUDGE
And?
Termeh is uncomfortable by her
parents’ presence.
JUDGE
Do you want them to wait
outside if it’s difficult for
you?
TERMEH
Can they?
143
JUDGE
(to Nader and
Simin)
Please wait outside.
Simin and Nader, who are both upset about their daughter
being placed in such a position, leave the room. They pass
the secretary’s room and come to the corridor. They each
stand in a corner and lean against the wall. They are both
concerned about the answer that Termeh will give and they
are worried.
The End
July 2010
