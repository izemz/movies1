- O'Sheel
INT. WELTON ACADAMY DINING HALL - DAY - VARIOUS SHOTS
(cid:13)
CREDITS ROLL
On the left is a (cid:13) life-sized mural depicting a group of young
school boys looking up adoringly at a woman who represents
liberty. On the right is a mural showing young men gathered
around an indus(cid:13) trialist in a corporate boardroom.
Between the murals stands a boy. An odd, blaring MUSICAL
SOUND starts and stops, interrupted by the noise of pumping.
A teacher hurries to the boy, adjusts his tie, and leads him
off. On another wall is a full-sized portrait of a 19th
century Scotsman in a kilt.
In front at this, young boys carrying banners, and several
elderly men in old-fashioned costumes assembling into a
processional formation. Nervous younger boys (7th graders)
are shown their places in line and handed candles.
(cid:13)
They light each others' candles until all their candles are
lit. Suddenly the MUSIC BLASTS FORTH in its full splendor.
It is a BAGPIPE. The bagpiper, in a k(cid:13) ilt like the one in the
portrait, begins a processional march.
INT. CORRIDOR ADJACENT THE DINING ROOM - SAME
The bagpiper enters a long slate and stone hall(cid:13) way. The
haunting timbre of his antiquated instrument reverberates
through the building. Momentarily, he is followed by the
other processional marchers. He leads them down the corridor
and down a threshold staircase into:
INT. WELTON'S OLD STONE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS
Where two hundred high school-aged boys -- most of who(cid:13) m wear
black blazers -- sit on either side of the central aisle
watching the procession move onto the dais in front. Beside
m(cid:13) ost of these boys are their parents.
VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE PROCESSION
FOUR 16-YEAR-OLD Boys CARRY BANNERS. Each boy is dressed in
an archaic, turn-of-the-century outfit. On each banner is
emblazoned a different word. One reads "TRADITION," another
reads "HONOR," a third reads "DISCIPLINE," the last reads
"EXCELLENCE."
THE ELDERLY MEN
in their 70s and 80s, obviously the school's oldest alumni,
each wearing a name tag and the uniform of his day, make
their way toward the stage.

THE SEVENTH GRADERS
carrying candles are nervous and self-conscious. Most
concentrate intently on keeping their candles lit while they
march. One young boy's candle has gone cut and he can barely
keep from crying.
The bagpiper stands at the corner of the dais, marching in
place. Behind him, in black robes, sit the school's 30-odd
teachers. The processional's elderly alumni fill the chairs
of honor on the dais.
The four young BANNER CARRIERS peel off from the main aisle
and take seats beside their parents in the audience. The 7th
graders take seats with their parents too.
A purple and black robed man who brings up the rear of the
procession walks up to the podium. He is HEADMASTER GALE
NOLAN, a big man, in his mid-60s. The music stops.
NOLAN
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished
alumni, and students: This year
marks the one hundredth year that
Welton Academy has been in
existence.
Applause begins. Soon the whole room is standing in a
thunderous ovation. After an appropriate amount of time,
Nolan motions for everyone to be seated.
NOLAN
One hundred years ago, in 1859,
forty-one boys sat in this room and
were asked the same question that
now greets you at the start of each
semester: Gentlemen, what are the
(cid:13) four pillars?
All of the students stand at attention. Find TODD ANDERSON
sitting between his parents. Todd is 16, good looking, but
he seems beaten down, lacking confidence, unhappy. He wears
a name tag and no Welton blazer. When the others stand,
Todd's mother nudges him. Todd stands. He watches as the
other students:
ALL THE BOYS IN UNISON
Tradition! Honor! Discipline!
Excellence!
All the boys sit. Todd sits too. All is silent again.

3.
NOLAN
In her first year, Welton Academy
graduated five students. Last year
we graduated fifty-one and over
seventy-five percent of those went
to the Ivy League!
Applause. During it we rind KNOX OVERSTREET and CHARLIE
DALTON, both 16, and both in Welton blazers. Knox (sitting
between his parents) carries a banner. He has curly hair,
looks outgoing, is short but well built. Charlie, also with
his parents, has a handsome yet friendly face. He carries no
banner but, when Nolan mentions Ivy League, both these boys
fit the bill.
NOLAN
This kind of accomplishment is the
result of fervent dedication to the
principles taught here. This is
why you parents have been sending
us your sons, and this is why we
are the best preparatory school in
the United States.
(more applause)
New students.
All turn to look at the new students the 7th graders and
transfer students. Todd Anderson is among them and he looks
incredibly self-conscious.
NOLAN
The key to your success rests on
our four pillars. These are the
bywords of this school and they
will become the cornerstones of
your lives. Welton Society
candidate Richard Cameron...
In the audience, not far from Todd is Richard CAMERON, one of
the banner carriers, 16, his father's little clone. He
stands eagerly to attention. Too eagerly.
CAMERON
Yes sir!
NOLAN
What is Tradition?
CAMERON
Tradition, Mr. Nolan, is love of
school, country, and family. Our
tradition at Welton is to be the
best!

NOLAN
Good, Mr. Cameron. Welton Society
Candidate George Hopkins. Honor.
Cameron sits. His father beams smugly.
HOPKINS (O.S.)
Honor is dignity and the
fulfillment of duty!
NOLAN
Good, Mr. Hopkins. Honor Society
Candidate, Knox Overstress Knox, as
mentioned, is a banner-holder.
He stands.
KNOX
Yes sir.
NOLAN
What is discipline?
KNOX
Discipline is respect for parents,
teachers, headmaster. Discipline
comes from within.
NOLAN
Thank you, Mr. Overstress. Honor
Candidate Neil Perry.
Knox sits. Knox's proud father and mother give him pats of
encouragement. NEIL PERRY stands. Whereas some boys have
two or three achievement pins an the lapels of their coats,
Neil has a huge cluster of them on the pocket of his jacket.
Neil is 16, intense, a born leader. However, there is more
than a hint of anger and dissatisfaction in his eyes. Beside
him sits his unsmiling father, MR. PERRY.
NOLAN
Excellence, Mr. Perry.
NEIL (ROTE)
Excellence is the result of hard
work. Excellence is the key to all
success, in school and everywhere.
Neil sits. He doesn't look at his father nor does his father
look at him.
(cid:13)

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
5.
NOLAN
Gentlemen, at Welton you will work
harder than you have ever worked in
your lives, and your reward will be
the success that all of us expect
of you. I would now like to call
to the podium Welton's oldest
living graduate - Mr. Alexander
Carmichael, Jr., Class of 1866.
An octogenarian on stage shuns help from those beside him and
makes his way slowly -- excruciatingly slowly -- to the
p(cid:13) odium as the audience rises to another standing ovation.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE WELTON ACADEMY - MAIN LAWN - DAY
Welton Academy is a cluster of traditional weathered stone
buildings. The time is 1959 but at Welton this is
irrelevant. This school with its traditions is completely
isolated from the politics or trends of the outside world.
The students stand with their parents under a giant tent.
Finger food, coffee, tea and punch are laid cut on white
clothed tables.
Charlie's mother stands dotingly fixing Charlie's hair. Then
she kisses him. Knox's father has his hand affectionately
around his son. Mr. Perry stands adjusting the achievement
pins on Neil's jacket. Todd Anderson's parents stand
chatting with another couple, paying no attention to Todd who
looks very much alone. Mr. Nolan walks by and looks at
Todd's name tag.
NOLAN
Ah, Mr. Anderson. You have some
big shoes to fill, young man. Your
brother was one of our best.
TODD
(faint, almost inaudible)
Thank you.
Neil's father, Neil in tow, approaches Nolan and interrupts.
MR. PERRY
(somewhat disturbed)
Gale, what's this I hear about a
new junior English teacher?
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13) (cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
6.
NOLAN
Mr. Gladden took the Headmaster's
post at Malford, so we've hired
John Keating.
MR. PERRY
(suspicious)
A former student, I hear?
NOLAN
A star student, Mr. Perry. And
he's spent the last ten years
teaching at the McMillan School in
Edinburgh.
MR. PERRY
(acting impressed)
Oh. McMillan.
Nolan looks around. He finds, then indicates: ACROSS THE
LAWN a black-robed teacher stands with his back to us,
staring at the beautiful Welton LAKE. As if he sensed he was
being watched, he turns and faces us. This is JOHN KEATING,
late 30s, sparkling eyes. Nolan puts his arm on Mr. Perry's
s(cid:13) houlder and leads him off.
NOLAN
Come meet him. You'll like him.
We watch Nolan escort Mr. Perry across the lawn and introduce
him to Mr. Keating who walks up to greet them. Todd stands
alone, looking around. Neil Perry, now left alone, does the
same. Both watch the other students saying good-byes to
their parents.
EXT. THE WELTON ACADEMY PARKING LOT - DAY
The 7th graders are saying good-bye to their parents. Chins
quiver. Young eyes hold back tears. Some boys sob. For
most of these young boys this is the first time in their
lives that they will be away from their parents and their
homes, and it is a devastating experience.
EXT. LONG SHOT, WELTON ACADEMY - SAME
Welton Academy sits in a lonely and isolated valley in woods
of Vermont. Though the setting is beautiful, its isolation
only highlights the loneliness that most of the 7th graders
feel at this moment.

INT. THE WELTON ACADEMY OAK PANELED HONOR ROOM - DAY
The 50 or so members of the junior class sit in chairs or
stand around the room. The students that were featured
earlier are here: Todd Anderson, Neil Perry, Knox
Overstress, Charlie Dalton, Richard Cameron. All except Todd
wear Welton blazers. Todd sticks out and he knows it. A
staircase against a wall leads to a 2nd-floor door. That
door opens and down the stairs file five boys. An old
teacher (DR. HAGER) comes to the door and calls out five
names.
HAGER
Overstreet, Perry, Dalton,
Anderson, Cameron.
These boys file up the staircase. As they do, a seated boy
(PITTS) leans to the boy next to him (STEVEN MEEKS). Meeks
has sweet egghead looks and very short hair. He wears a
p(cid:13) ocket watch and chain.
PITTS
Who's the new boy?
MEEKS
(shrugs)
Anderson.
Old Hager sees this conversation.
HAGER
Misters Pitts and Meeks. Demerits.
Pitts and Meeks look down. Pitts glances at Necks and rolls
his eyes.
HAGER
That's another demerit, Mr. Pitts.
Pitts' smile vanishes. Hager closes the door.
INT THE HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - SAME
The five boys take seats in a row of chairs facing Mr. Nolan.
Nolan sits behind his desk, a HUNTING DOG on the floor beside
him.
NOLAN
Welcome back, Mr. Dalton. How's
your father?
CHARLIE
Doing fine, sir.

NOLAN
Your family move into that new
house, Mr. Overstreet?
KNOX
Yes sir, about a month ago.
NOLAN
Wonderful. I hear It's beautiful.
(he gives the dog a snack)
Mr. Anderson, since you're new
here, let me explain that at
Welton, I assign extracurricular
activities on the basis of merit
and desire. These activities are
taken every bit as seriously as
your class work... right, boys?
CHARLIE, CAMERON, KNOX
Yes sir!
NOLAN
Failure to attend required meetings
will result in demerits. Mr.
Dalton the school paper, the
Service Club, soccer, rowing. Mr.
Overstress Welton Society
Candidates, the school paper,
soccer, Sons of Alumni Club. Mr.
Perry Welton Society Candidates,
Chemistry Club, Mathematics Club,
school annual, soccer. Mr. Cameron
Welton Society Candidates, Debate
Club, rowing, Service Club,
forensics, Honor Council. Mr.
Anderson based on your record at
Balincrest, soccer, Service Club,
school annual. Anything else I
don't know about?
Todd struggles. He looks like he is trying to speak but
n(cid:13) othing is coming out of his mouth.
NOLAN
Speak up, Mr. Anderson.
TODD
(barely audible)
I would prefer rowing sir.
It is apparent that Todd's fear of speaking is overwhelming.
Nolan looks at him.

NOLAN
Rowing? Did he say rowing? It
says here you played soccer at
Balincrest.
TODD
(again barely audible)
I... did... but...
Sweat breaks out on Todd's brow. He clinches his hands,
turning his knuckles white. He looks like he is going to
burst into tears. The other boys look at him.
NOLAN
You'll like soccer here, Anderson.
Dismissed.
The boys stand and exit. Todd looks absolutely miserable.
The teacher at the door calls out more names.
EXT. WELTON CAMPUS - DAY
The Welton students walk toward their dorms. Neil Perry
approaches Todd Anderson who walks alone. Neil offers his
handshake.
NEIL
I hear we're going to be roommates.
Neil Perry.
TODD
(softly)
Todd Anderson.
Todd keeps walking. There is an awkward silence.
NEIL
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
TODD
(overlap)
My brother went here.
NEIL
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
INT. THE JUNIOR DORM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Neil and Todd have walked into the dorm lobby.

Don't expect to like it here.
TODD
I don't.
INT. THE WELTON JUNIOR CLASS DORMITORY ROOM - DAY
Each small room contains two single beds, two closets, and
two desks. Suitcases sit on the floor. Neil enters.
Richard Cameron sticks in his head.
CAMERON
Heard you got the new boy. He's a
hell of a speaker, huh? Oops.
Todd Anderson walks in. Cameron ducks out. Todd has heard
Cameron's comment, but he ignores it. He puts his suitcase
on his bed and begins unpacking.
NEIL
Don't mind Cameron. He's an
asshole.
There is a knock on the door. Knox Overstress, Charlie
Dalton, and Steven Meeks enter. Charlie speaks to Neil.
CHARLIE
Hey, I heard you went to summer
school?
NEIL
Yeah, chemistry. My father thought
I should get ahead.
CHARLIE
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't
quite flunk English so if you want,
we've got our study group.
NEIL
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.
Anybody mind including him?
CHARLIE
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?

Todd. Anderson.
Knox and Charlie offer Todd handshakes.
CHARLIE
Charlie Dalton.
KNOX
Knox Overstreet.
Todd shakes their hands.
NEIL
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
CHARLIE
Oh yeah. Sure. Valedictorian,
National Merit Scholar...
Todd nods affirmative.
MEEKS
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
CHARLIE
It's every bit as hard as they say.
Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
MEEKS
He flatters me so I'll help him

MEEKS, CHARLIE, KNOX
Mr. Perry.
MR. PERRY
Keep your seats, boys. How's it
going?
THE BOYS
Fine, sir. Thank you.
MR. PERRY
Neil, I've decided that you're
taking too many extracurricular
activities. I've spoken to Mr.
Nolan about it and you can work on
t(cid:13) he school annual next year.
NEIL
But father, I'm assistant editor.
MR. PERRY
I'm sorry, Neil.
NEIL
But father, it's not fair.
MR. PERRY
Fellows, would you excuse us a
minute?
Mr. Perry walks into the hall, Neil follows.
INT. THE JUNIOR DORMITORY HALLWAY - SAME

as you please. Until then, you
will listen to me.
NEIL
Yes sir. I'm sorry.
MR. PERRY
You know what this means to your
mother, don't you?
NEIL
Yes sir.
Using the pressures of guilt and punishment, Mr. Perry is the
most subtle of bullies. Neil's resolve crumbles in front of
his authoritarian father. Neil fills the pause.
NEIL
You know me, always taking on too
much.
MR. PERRY
Good boy. Call us if you need
anything.
He turns and walks off.
INT. NEIL'S ROOM
The others wait in silence. A chastened Neil enters.
CHARLIE
Why doesn't he let you do what you
want?
KNOX
Yeah! Tell him off! It couldn't
get any worse.
NEIL
Oh that's rich. Like you tell your
parents off, Mr. Future Lawyer and
Mr. Future Banker!
Neil takes the school annual achievement pin off his shirt
and hurls it at his desk.

And you'll be approving loans till
you croak.
CHARLIE
Okay, so I don't like it any more
than you do. I'm just saying...
NEIL
Then don't tell me how to talk to
my father when you're the same way.
A(cid:13) ll right?!
KNOX
All right. Jesus, what are you
gonna do?
NEIL
What I have to do. Screw the
annual.
MEEKS
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep
over it. It's just a bunch of
people trying to impress Nolan.
NEIL
(bitterly)
Screw it all. I don't give a damn
about any of it.
He slams his hand into his pillow and lies back silently.
Everyone is quiet, sensing Neil's disappointment. Finally,
Charlie breaks the silence.
CHARLIE
I don't know about anyone else, but
I could use a refresher in Latin.
Eight o'clock in my room?
NEIL
Sure.
CHARLIE
You're welcome to join us, Todd.

TODD
Thank you.
The boys leave. Neil lies in silence. He sees the
achievement pin that he threw and picks it up. Todd
continues to unpack. He unpacks a photo of his mother and
father with their arms around an older boy who is obviously
Todd's brother Jeffrey. Todd stands to one side, slightly
apart from the family group. Todd unpacks an engraved
leather desk set (pens, blotter, etc.) and puts it on his
desk.
NEIL
So what do you think of my father?
TODD
(softly, to himself)
I'll take him over mine.
NEIL
What?
TODD
Nothing.
NEIL
Todd, if you're gonna make it
around here, you've gotta speak up.
The meek might inherit the earth
but they don't get into Harvard.
Know what I mean?
Todd nods.
NEIL
The goddamn bastard!
He presses the metal point of the pin into his thumb, drawing
blood. Todd winces. Neil doesn't. Neil hurls the pin
again.
INT. A CHEMISTRY CLASSROOM - DAY
The classroom is a laboratory: filled with flasks, etc. Neil,
Todd, Knox, Charlie, Cameron, Meeks and other members of the
junior class sit around the room. A bespectacled teacher
s(cid:13) tands in front, passing out thick textbooks.

CHEMISTRY TEACHER
In addition to the assignments in
the text, you will each pick three
lab experiments from the project
list and report on one every five
weeks. The first twenty problems
at the end of chapter one are due:
tomorrow.
ANGLE ON CHARLIE DALTON as the thick textbooks arrive at his
desk. He shoots a disbelieving glance at Knox Overstreet who
can only acknowledge with a shake of his head. Todd takes
his books without reacting.
INT. LATIN CLASS - DAY
The same students sit before a Latin teacher in his early
60s. He declines a Latin noun with a thick Scottish brogue.
LATIN TEACHER (MCALLISTER)
Agricola, agricolae, agricolas,
Agricolas, agricolatis,
agricolatus.
ANGLE FAVORING TODD, NEIL, KNOX AND THE OTHERS as they
struggle to follow along with McAllister's lesson.
INT. A MATHEMATICS CLASS - DAY
Mathematical charts hang on the walls. The elderly bald
teacher (the one from Nolan's doorway), Dr. Hager, passes out
books. The students' work load is huge.
HAGER
Your study of trigonometry requires
absolute precision. Anyone failing
to turn in any homework assignment
will be penalized one point off his
final grade. Let me urge you now
not to test me on this point. Who
would like to begin by defining a
cosine?
Richard Cameron stands.
CAMERON
A cosine is the sin of the
compliment of an angle or arc. If
we define an angle A, then...

INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY
The junior students -- Todd, Neil, Knox, Charlie, Cameron,
Meeks and some of the others we've seen -- enter. They are
loaded down with books and look weary.
Sitting in the front of the room, staring out the window is
JOHN KEATING, the teacher we glimpsed earlier. He wears a
collared shirt, tie, no jacket.
The boys take seats and settle in. Keating stares out the
window a long time. The students start to shuffle
uncomfortably.
Finally Keating stands, picks up a yardstick, and begins
slowly strolling the aisles. He stops and stares into the
f(cid:13) ace of one of the boys.
KEATING
(to the blushing boy)
Don't be embarrassed.
He moves off, then stops in front of Charlie Dalton.
KEATING
(as if discovering
something known only to
himself)
Uh-huh.
(he moves to Todd
Anderson)
Uh-huh.
(he moves to Neil Perry)
Ha!
Keating slaps his free hand with the yardstick, then strides
to the front of the room.
KEATING
Nimble young minds!
He steps up onto the desk, turns and faces the class.
KEATING
(energetically)
Oh Captain, My Captain. Who knows
where that's from?
No one raises a hand.
KEATING
It was written by a poet named Walt
Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

In this claKsEsA TyIoNuG (mCaOyN Tr'eDf)er to me
as either Mr. Keating, or Oh
Captain, My Captain.
Keating steps down and starts, strolling the aisles.
KEATING
So that I become the source of as
few rumors as possible, let me tell
you that yes, I was a student at
this institution many moons ago,
and no, at that time I did not
possess this charismatic
personality. However, should you
choose to emulate my manner, it can
only help your grade.
Pick up a textbook from the back, gentlemen, and let's retire
to the honor room. He steps off the desk and walks out. The
students sit, not sure what to do, then realize they are to
follow him. They quickly gather their books, pick up texts,
and follow.
INT. THE WELTON OAK PANELED HONOR ROOM - DAY
This is the room where the boys waited earlier. The walls
are lined with class pictures: dating back into the 1800s.
School trophies of every description fill trophy cases and
shelves. Keating leads the students in, then faces the
c(cid:13) lass.
KEATING
Mister...
(Keating looks at his
roll)
Pitts. An unfortunate name. Stand
up, Mister Pitts.
Pitts stands.
KEATING
Open your text, Pitts, to page
forty and read for us the first
stanza of the poem.
Pitts looks through his book. He finds the poem.
PITTS
"To The Virgins to Make Much Of
Time?"

Giggles in the class. Pitts reads.
PITTS
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
Old time is still a flying
And this same flower that smiles today
Tomorrow will be dying."
KEATING
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
The Latin term for that sentiment
is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what
that means?
MEEKS
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
KEATING
Very good, Mr....?
MEEKS
Meeks.
KEATING
Seize the day while you're young,
see that you make use of your time.
Why does the poet write these
lines?
A STUDENT
Because he's in a hurry?
KEATING
Because we're food for worms, lads!
Because we're only going to
experience a limited number of
springs, summers, and falls. One
day, hard as it is to believe, each
and every one of us is going to
stop breathing, turn cold, and die!
Stand up and peruse the faces of
the boys who attended this school
sixty or seventy years ago. Don't
be timid, go look at them.
The boys get up. Todd, Neil, Knox, Meeks, etc. go over to
the class pictures that line the honor room walls.
ANGLES ON VARIOUS PICTURES ON THE WALLS. Faces of young men
stare at us from out of the past.

KEATING
They're not that different than any
of you, are they? There's hope in
their eyes, just like in yours.
They believe themselves destined
for wonderful things, just like
many of you. Well, where are those
smiles now, boys? What of that
(cid:13) hope?
THE BOYS are staring at the pictures, sobered by what Keating
is saying.
KEATING
Did most of them not wait until it
was too late before making their
lives into even one iota of what
they were capable? In chasing the
almighty deity of success did they
not squander their boyhood dreams?
Most of those gentlemen are
fertilizing daffodils! However, if
you get very close, boys, you can
hear them whisper. Go ahead, lean
in. Hear it?
(loud whisper)
"Carpe Diem, lads. Seize the day.
Make your lives extraordinary."
Todd, Neil, Knox, Charlie, Cameron, Meeks, Pitts all stare
into the pictures on the wall. All are lost in thought.
EXT. THE WELTON CAMPUS - DAY
The class files out of the honor room. Todd, Neil, Knox,
Charlie, Cameron, Necks, and Pitts walk together, books in
hand. All thinking about what just happened in class.
PITTS
Weird.

How about a trig study group?
Right after dinner.
VARIOUS BOYS
Good by me. Sure. Great.
KNOX
I can't make it. I gotta sign out
to have dinner at the Danburrys'
house.
PITTS
Who are the Danburrys?
CAMERON
Big alums. How'd you pull that?
KNOX
They're friends of my dad.
Probably in their nineties or
something.
NEIL
Listen, anything's better than
mystery meat.
CHARLIE
I'll second that.
The group disperses. Neil finds himself walking near Todd
w(cid:13) ho has been silent through this whole discussion.
NEIL
Want to come to the study group?
TODD
Thanks but... I'd better do
history.
INT. TODD AND NEIL'S DORM ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Todd enters alone. He puts down his books and sits at his
desk. Flipping through the stack of books in front of him,
he sighs at the work load that is piling up. Todd takes out
his notebook and opens his history book.

He stares at his notebook for a moment, then writes "SEIZE

written, sighs, tears the page off, then plunges into his
homework.
EXT. THE WELTON CAMPUS - DUSK - WIDE SHOT
The autumnal colors are muted by the onset of nightfall. Old
Dr. Hager drives the school "woody" station wagon out of the
campus.
EXT. WALTON VILLAGE (NEW CASTLE) - DUSK - WOODY DRIVE-BY
EXT./INT. A LARGE MANSION - DUSK
Knox Overstreet gets out of the woody. Dr. Hager pulls away.
Knox walks to the door of the home and is admitted by a maid.
Knox is amazed by this palatial home.
INT. THE DANBURRY MANSION LIBRARY - DUSK
JOE DANBURRY is a sharp looking man of about 40, well
dressed, friendly. His wife, an attractive blonde about the
same age, sits beside him.
JOE DANBURRY
Knox, come in. Joe Danburry. This
is my wife, Janette.
KNOX
(surprised)
Nice to meet you.
MRS. DANBURRY
You're the spitting image of your
father. How is he?
KNOX
Great. Just did a big case for GM.
JOE DANBURRY
Ah. I know where you're headed.
Like father like son, eh?
(looking off screen)
Ginny. Come meet Knox.

Ginny, mom.
Knox shakes her hand. His "hello" is polite. Her "hi" is
shy. CHET DANBURRY -- a tall jock of a guy a couple of years
older than Knox -- enters. With him is a lovely teenage
brunette, CHRIS NOEL, in a short tennis dress. Soft glowing
eyes, athletic figure, this girl is stunning.
CHET
Dad, can I take the Buick?
JOE DANBURRY
What's wrong with your car?
MRS. DANBURRY
Chet, where are your manners?
Knox, this is my son Chet and his
girlfriend Chris Noel. This is
Knox Overstreet. Excuse me while I
check on dinner.
CHET
(perfunctorily)
Hi.
Knox shakes Chet's hand. Knox is THUNDERSTRUCK by Chris.
Chris offers Knox her hand and a smile. Knox shakes her
hand, his mouth practically hanging open.
CHRIS
Pleased to meet you.
KNOX
The pleasure is mine.
CHET
Come on, Dad, why is this always a
big deal?
JOE DANBURRY
Because I bought you a sports car
and suddenly you want my car all
the time.
CHET
Chris' mom feels safer when we're
in a bigger car. Right, Chris?
Chet shoots her a wicked smile. Chris blushes.

CHET

Knox, Ginny, and Chris remain in the room. Knox smiles at
Chris.
KNOX
So, uh, where are you in school?
CHRIS
Ridgeway High. How's Henley Hall,
Gin?
GINNY
(flat)
Okay.
CHRIS
(to Knox)
That's your sister school, right?
KNOX
Sort of.
CHRIS
(to Ginny)
You going out for the Henley Hall
play?
(to Knox)
They're doing "A Midsummer Night's
D(cid:13) ream."
GINNY
Maybe.
KNOX
How did you meet Chet?
(both girls look at him)
I mean... Er...
CHRIS
He plays on the Ridgeway football
team and I'm a cheerleader. He
used to go to Welton but he flunked
out.

CHRIS

KNOX

Nice meeting you, Chris.
Chris and Chet exit. Through the window, we see Chet and
Chris walk out and put their arms around each other.
GINNY
(confiding to Knox)
Chet just wants the Buick so they
can go parking.
KNOX
Oh.
Outside, Chris and Chet get in the Buick and kiss. Knox
stares with envy.
GINNY
Something wrong?
KNOX
Nah.
EXT. DANBURRY HOUSE - DUSK
Chet and Chris drive off.
INT. THS JUNIOR CLASS LOUNGE - NIGHT
The dorm is quiet. Neil, Cameron, Weeks, Charlie and Pitts
are gathered studying math. As they do, Pitts works to
assemble a small crystal radio. Todd is in his room,
studying alone. Knox, looking shell-shocked, shuffles into
the lobby.
CHARLIE

KNOX
She's practically engaged to Chet
Danburry. Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
PITTS
Too bad.
KNOX
It's not too bad. It's a tragedy!
Why does she have to be in love
with a jerk?!
PITTS
All the good ones go for jerks, you
know that. Forget her. Take out
your trig book and figure out
problem twelve.
KNOX
I can't just forget her, Pitts.
And I certainly can't think about
m(cid:13) ath!
MEEKS
Sure you can. You're off on a
tangent -- so you're halfway into
trig already...
CAMERON
Duh, Meeks!
MEEKS
(sheepishly)
I thought it was clever.
KNOX
(sitting down)
You really think I should forget
her?
PITTS
You have another choice.
Knox drops to his knee like he is proposing.

beginning to wash over him.
EXT. WELTON CAMPUS - MORNING
The Welton bagpiper marches on the lawn, practicing.
Students emerge from their dorms and head to breakfast.
INT. KEATING'S ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
The lights are out and shades are drawn. Keating sits in a
chair beside the teacher's desk. He looks solemn. All is
still.
KEATING
(soft and soothing voice)
Boys, quietly open your texts to
page fifty four.
The boys follow instructions. Keating reads the following in
a tone of quiet reverence.
KEATING
"Little Boy Blue," by Eugene Field:
"The little toy dog is covered with dust,
But sturdy and staunch he stands.
And the little toy soldier is red with rust,
And his musket moulds in his hands;
Time was when the little toy dog was new,
And the soldier was passing fair;
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue,
Kissed them and put them there.
'Now don't you go till I come,' he said,
'And don't you make any noise!'
So toddling off to his trundle bed
He dreamt of pretty toys;
And as he was dreaming, an angel song,
Awakened our Little Boy Blue --
Oh the years are many, the years are long,
But the little toy friends are true.
Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,
Each in the same old place --
Awaiting the touch of a little hand,
The smile of a little face.
And they wonder, as waiting the long years thru,
In the dust of that little chair,
What has become of our Little Boy Blue,
Since he kissed them and put them there.
Keating is a masterful reader. With his marvelous voice, he
has milked this sentimental poem for everything it is worth.
Many of the boys are on the verge of tears. Suddenly Keating
s(cid:13) houts:

AHHGGGG!!
The students jump halfway out of their seats.
KEATING
Treacle! Mawkish treacle! Rip it
out of your books. Rip out the
entire page! I want this
sentimental rubbish in the trash
where it belongs!
He marches down the aisles with the trash can and waits for
each boy to deposit the page from his textbook. The boys,
having been led down the sentimental path, cannot help but
laugh at this sudden change of mood.
KEATING
Make a clean tear. I want nothing
left of it! Eugene Field!
Disgraceful.
INT.MCALLISTER'S CLAS5RDOM - DAY
Mr. McAllister, the Scottish Latin teacher, exits his room
and walks across the hall to Keating's classroom. He peeks
in the door window and sees boys ripping pages out of their
books. Alarmed, McAllister opens the door and enters
Keating's room.
INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - SAME
McAllister is about to reprimand the boys when suddenly he
sees Keating. McALLISTER What the... Sorry, I didn't think
you were in here, Mr. Keating. Baffled and embarrassed,
McAllister exits. Keating strides back to the front of the
room, flips the trash can on the floor, and jumps into it.
He stomps the trash a few times, then kicks the can away.
KEATING
This is battle, boys. War! You
are souls at a critical juncture.
Either you will succumb to the will
of hoi polloi and the fruit will
die on the vine -- or you will
triumph as individuals. It may be
a coincidence that part of my
duties are to teach you about
Romanticism, but let me assure you
that I take the task quite
seriously.

stones to everything you might
endeavor to do in life and do well.
A moment ago I used the term 'hoi
polloi.' Who knows what it means?
Come (cid:13) on, Overstreet, you twirp.
(laughter)
Anderson, are you a man or a boil?
More laughter. All eyes are on Todd. He visibly tenses all
over. He cannot bring himself to speak. He shakes his head
jerkily "no." Meeks raises his hands and speaks:
MEEKS
The hoi polloi. Doesn't it mean
the herd?
KEATING
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the
herd. However, be warned that,
when you say "the hoi polloi" you
are actually saying "the the herd."
Indicating that you too are "hoi
polloi."
Keating grins wryly. Meeks smiles. More chuckles. Keating
paces to the back of the room.
KEATING
Now, many will argue that
nineteenth -- century literature
has nothing to do with business
school or medical school. They
think we should I read our Field
and Pipple, learn our rhyme and
meter, and quietly go about it our
business of achieving other
ambitions.
He slams his hand on the wall behind him. The wall booms
like a drum. The boys jump and turn around.
KEATING
(defiant whisper)
Well, I say drivel! One reads
poetry because he is a member of
the human race and the human race

Of the endless trains of the faithless
of cities filled with the foolish...
skipping...
What good amid these O me, O life?
Answer: That you are here --
That life exists and identity
That the powerful play goes on, and
you may contribute a verse."
K(cid:13) eating pauses. The class sits, taking this in.
KEATING
(awestruck tone)
"That the powerful play goes on,
and you may contribute a verse."
Incredible.
(pause)
Poetry is rapture, lads. Without
it we are doomed.
Keating waits a long moment.
KEATING
What will your verse be?
CLOSE ON the faces of NEIL, KNOX, CHARLIE, MEEKS, CAMERON,
PITTS, and TODD as they contemplate this question. Softly,
Keating breaks the mood:
KEATING
Let's open our textbooks to page
sixty and learn about Wordsworth

INT. THE WELTON DINING ROOM - DAY

So does Keating.
MCALLISTER
You take a big risk encouraging
them to be artists, John. When
they realize they're not Rembrants
or Shakespeares or Picassos,
they'll hate you for it.
KEATING
Not artists, George, free thinkers.

CHARLIE
Thigh man? Mr. "K" was a hell
raiser.
KNOX
What is the Dead Poets Society?
MEEKS
Any group pictures in the annual?
NEIL
Nothing. No mention of it.
CHARLIE
Nolan.
Mr. Nolan approaches the boys' table. Under the table,
Cameron insistently hands the annual to Todd. Todd looks at
Cameron, then takes it.
NOLAN
Enjoying your classes, Mr. Perry?
NEIL
Yes sir. Very much.
NOLAN
And our Mr. Keating. Finding him
interesting, boys?
CHARLIE
Yes sir. We were just talking
about that.
NOLAN
Good. We're very excited about
him. He was a Rhodes Scholar, you
know.
Nolan exits. Todd looks at the annual that he hides in his
lap under the table, then continues eating.
EXT. THE CAMPUS - LATER
Keating walks across the school lawn wearing his sport coat
and a scarf, carrying his books. Pitts, Neil, Cameron, Knox,
Charlie, Meeks and Todd approach him.
NEIL
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My
Captain.

KEATING
Ah, so you boy's have been
snooping.
NEIL
I was just looking in an old annual
and...
KEATING
Nothing wrong with research.
The boys wait for more.
NEIL
But what was it?
Keating checks around to be sure they are unwatched.
KEATING
The Dead Poets was a secret
organization. I don't know how the
present administration would look
upon it but I doubt the reaction
would be favorable. Can you keep a
secret?
A(cid:13) n instant sea of nods.
KEATING
The Dead Poets Society was
dedicating to sucking the marrow
out of life. That phrase is by
Thoreau and was invoked at every
meeting. A small group of us would
meet at a cave and there we would
take turns reading Shelley,
Thoreau, Whitman, our own verse --
any number of poets -- and, in the
enchantment of the moment, let them
work their magic on us.
KNOX
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around reading poetry?
KEATING
(amused)
Both sexes participated, Mr.
Overstreet. And, believe me, we
did not simply read, we let it drip
from our tongues like honey. Women
swooned, spirits soared... Gods
were created, gentlemen.

34.
The boys think a minute.
NEIL
What did the name mean? Did you
only read dead poets?
KEATING
All poetry was acceptable. The
name simply referred to the fact,
that to join the organization, you
had to be dead.
SEVERAL
What?
KEATING
Full membership required a lifetime
of apprenticeship. The living were
simply pledges. Alas, even I am
still a lowly initiate.
The boys don't quite know what to say.
KEATING
The last meeting must have been 25
years ago. Hasn't been another
since.
Keating exits. The boys stand watching. Neil turns to them.
NEIL
I say we go tonight. Everybody in?
PITTS
Where is this cave he's talking
about?
NEIL
Beyond the stream. I think I know.
PITTS
That's miles.
CAMERON
Sounds boring to me.
CHARLIE
Don't come.
CAMERON
You know how many demerits we're
talking?

CHARLIE
So don't goddamn come! Please.
CAMERON
All I'm saying is we have to be
c(cid:13) areful. We can't get caught.
CHARLIE
(sarcastic)
Well, no shit, Sherlock.
NEIL
Who's in?
CHARLIE
I'm in.
Neil looks at Knox, Pitts, and Weeks.
PITTS
Well...
CHARLIE
Oh come on, Pitts...
MEEKS
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
NEIL
Then you can help him.
PITTS
What is this, a midnight study
group?
NEIL
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.
Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Laughter.
MEEKS
All right. I'll try anything once.
CHARLIE
Except sex.
More laughter. Meeks blushes.
CAMERON
I'm in as long as we're careful.

CHARLIE
Knox?
KNOX
I don't know. I don't get it.
CHARLIE
Come on. It'll help you get Chris.
KNOX
It will? How do you figure?
CHARLIE
Women swoon!
KNOX
But why?
The group walk off. Knox holds, then follows,
KNOX
Why do they swoon?! Charlie, tell
me why they swoon!
Knox moves off after the others. Todd remains behind. No
one asked Todd and he moves off by himself.
INT. THE STUDY HALL - LATE AFTERNOON
Students study. Neil sits near Todd.
NEIL
(hushed voice)
Listen, I'm inviting you. You
can't expect everybody to think of
you all the time. Nobody knows
you.
TODD
Thanks but it's not a question of
that.
NEIL
What is it then?
TODD
I... I just don't want to come.
NEIL
But why? Don't you understand what
Keating is saying? Don't you want
to do something about it?
(cid:13) (cid:13)

TODD
Yes. But...
NEIL
Put what? Goddamn it, tell me.
TODD
I don't want to read.
NEIL
What?
TODD
Keating said everybody took turns
reading. I don't want to do it.
NEIL
God, you really have a problem,
don't you? How can it hurt you to
read? I mean isn't that what this
(cid:13) is all about? Expressing yourself?
INT. THE DORM - LATE NIGHT
Old Dr. Hager, the resident dorm marshal, putters in his
room, door ajar, making tea. Neil, Charlie, Knox, Meeks,
Pitts, Cameron, and Todd sneak silently past his door and
out.
EXT. THE WELTON CAMPUS - NIGHT
The school hunting dog comes up and growls at the boys. Pitts
slips the dog a piece of food and it goes away.
EXT. THE SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT
The stars are out and the wind is blowing. A SERIES of SHOTS
show the boys crossing the campus. They reach a stone wall
with an old iron gate that is chained shut. The boys squeeze
through the gate and disappear into the woods beyond.
EXT. THE WELTON WOODS AND STREAM - NIGHT
The boys make their way through the eerie forest searching
for the cave. They reach the bank of the stream and begin
looking for an appropriate spot amongst the tree roots and
erosion. Charlie suddenly looms out of the cave entrance.
CHARLIE
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
(cid:13)
(cid:13)

MEEKS
(frightened)
Ahh!
(then recovering)
Eat it, Dalton!
CHARLIE
This is it.
SHORT DISSOLVE
TO:
INT. THE CAVE - A BIT LATER
A newly lit fire comes to life... The boys huddle around the
flames.
NEIL
I hereby reconvene the Welton
Chapter of the Dead Poets Society.
These meetings will be conducted by
myself and by the rest of the new
initiates now present. Todd
Anderson, because he prefers not to
read, will keep minutes of the
meetings.
Todd is unhappy with this role but he tries not to show it.
NEIL
I will now read the traditional
opening message from society member
Henry David Thoreau.
Neil opens Keating's (cid:13)copy of Thoreau's Walden, and reads.
NEIL
"I went to the woods because I
wanted to live deliberately."
(skips thru the text)
"I wanted to live deep and suck out
all the marrow of life!"
CHARLIE
All right. I'll second that.
NEIL
"To put the rout all that was not
life.
(skips thru the text)
And not, when I came to die,
discover that I had not lived."
Pledge Overstreet.
(cid:13)
(cid:13) (cid:13)

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
39.
Knox steps up. Neil hands him Walden. Knox flips thru the
book until he finds another underlined passage. He reads.
KNOX
"The millions are awake enough for
physical labor; but only one in a
million is awake enough for
effective intellectual exertion,
only one in a hundred millions to a
poetic or divine life. To be awake
is to be alive."
CHARLIE
Hey, this is great.
Knox hands the bock to Cameron. Cameron reads.
CAMERON
"If one advances confidently in the
direction of his dreams and
endeavors to live the life which he
has imagined, he will meet with a
success unexpected in common
hours."
KNOX
Yes! I want success with Chris!
Cameron hands the book to Todd. Todd holds the book, frozen.
Before the others notice Todd's fear, Neil takes the book
from Todd and hands it to Meeks.
MEEKS
"If you have built castles in the
air, your work need not be lost.
That is where they should be. Now
put foundations under them."
NEIL
God, I want to do everything! I'm
going to explode.
Neil looks imbued with the desire to break out of his mold.
He slams the palms of his hands together with an expression
of determination. Charlie opens a book he brought and flips
through it.
CHARLIE
Listen to this:
"Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be for my
unconquerable soul!"
(cid:13)
(cid:13)

PULL BACK from this small band of boys standing huddled in
the night. Something is swirling their heads, something
alive and exciting like the wind and the swaying trees that
s(cid:13) urround them. Charlie raises his hands in the air.
CHARLIE
I here and now commit myself to
daring!
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
KEATING
So avoid using the word 'very'
because it's lazy. A man is not
very tired, he is exhausted. Don't
use very sad, use morose. Language
was invented for one reason, boys --
to woo women -- and, in that
endeavor, laziness will not do. It
also won't do in your essays.
The class laughs appreciatively. Keating closes his book,
then walks over and raises a map that covers the blackboard
in the front of the room. On the board is a quote, which
Keating reads aloud:
KEATING
"Creeds and schools in abeyance I
permit to speak at every hazard,
Nature without check, with original
energy." -- Walt Whitman. Ah, but
the difficulty of ignoring those
creeds and schools, conditioned as
we are by our parents, our
traditions, by the modern age. How
do we, like Whitman, permit our own
true natures to speak? How do we
strip ourselves of prejudices,
habits, influences? The answer, my
dear lads, is that we must
constantly endeavor to find a new
point of view.
He leaps onto his desk.
KEATING
Why do I stand here? To feel
taller than you? I stand on my
desk to remind myself that we must
constantly force ourselves to look
at things differently.

The world lKoEoAkTsI NdGi(fCfOeNrTe'nDt) from up
here. If you don't believe it,
stand up here and try it. All of
you. Take turns.
Keating jumps off. The boys, with the notable exception of
Todd, go to the front of the room and a few at a time take
turns standing on Keating's desk. As they do, Keating
strolls up and down the aisles.
KEATING
Try never to think about anything
the same way twice. If you're sure
about something, force yourself to
think about it another way, even if
you know it's wrong or silly. When
you read, don't consider only what
the author thinks, but take the
time to consider what you think.
You must strive to find your own
voice, boys, and the longer you
wait to begin, the less likely you
are to find it at all. Thoreau
said, "Most men lead lives of quiet
desperation." I ask, why be
resigned to that? Risk walking new
ground. Now. A flame in your
hearts could change the world,
lads. Nurture it.
Keating goes to the door. He locks at the class, then
flashes the room lights on and off over and over. He makes a
noise like crashing thunder.
KEATING
In addition to your essays, I want
you each to write a poem --
something your own to be delivered
aloud in class. See you Monday.
He exits. Momentarily, he pops his head back in.
KEATING
(impish grin)
And don't think I don't know this
assignment scares you to death, Mr.
Anderson, you mole.
Keating holds out his hands and pretends he is sending
lightning bolts at Todd. The class laughs. Todd forces a
hint of a smile.

INT./EXT. WELTON CAMPUS, AFTERNOON - VARIOUS LOCATIONS
Pitts and Meeks climb up the inside of the bell tower that
sits atop the Welton Chapel. They affix Pitts' crystal radio
antenna to the chapel cross. Momentarily, they tune in a
f(cid:13) uzzy rock 'n roll station.
PITTS
Radio Free America.
They try to tune in the music but it soon dissolves into
static. They jiggle the radio in frustration. Some of the
Welton students run on the green, kicking soccer balls. Down
at the lake, the Welton crew team is practicing. Mr. Nolan
sits in a rowboat, smoking a pipe, watching.
Knox rides down a wooded lane on his bike. He comes to
RIDGEWAY HIGH SCHOOL. Beyond a fence, uniformed boys
practice football. Not far from them, cheerleaders practice.
Knox stops. He sees: Among the cheerleaders is Chris. She
laughs as she practices the cheers with the other girls.
Knox watches her with intense longing in his eyes. Chet
Danburry catches a pass in front of Chris, struts for her
amusement, then moves on. Chris laughs. Knox gets back on
his bike and pedals away.
INT. TODD AND NEIL'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
Todd sits at his bed, a pad of paper beside him. He starts
to write something, scratches it out, then covers his face in
frustration. The door opens. Neil enters, looking like he's
just seen God. He lets his books fall to his desk.
NEIL
I've found it.
TODD
Found what?
NEIL
What I want to do! Right now.
What is really inside of me.
He hands Todd a piece of paper. Todd reads it.
TODD
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is
it?
NEIL
A play, dummy.

I know that. What's it got to do
w(cid:13) ith you?
NEIL
They're putting it on at Henley
Hall. See, open try-outs.
TODD
So?
NEIL
So I'm gonna act! Ever since I can
remember I've wanted to try it.
Last summer I even tried to go to
summer stock auditions but of
course my father wouldn't let me.
TODD
And now he will?
NEIL
Hell no, but that's not the point.
The point is for the first time in
my whole goddamned life, I know
what I want, and for the first time
I'm gonna do it whether my father
wants me to or not! Carpe diem,
goddamn it!
Neil picks up the play and reads a coupe of lines aloud.
They delight him. He clenches his fists in the air with joy.
TODD
Neil, how are you gonna be in a
play if your father won't let you?
NEIL
First I gotta get the part, then
I'll worry about that.
TODD
Won't he kill you if you don't let
him know you're auditioning?
NEIL
As far as I'm concerned, he won't
have to know about any of it.
TODD
Come on, that's impossible.

NEIL
Horseshit. Nothing's impossible.
TODD
Why don't you ask him first? Maybe
he'll say yes.
NEIL
That's a laugh. If I don't ask, at
least I won't be disobeying him.
TODD
But if he said no before then...
NEIL
Jesus Christ, whose side are you
on? I haven't even gotten the part
yet. Can't I enjoy the idea even
for a little while?
Todd turns back to his work. Neil sits on the bed and starts
reading the play.
NEIL
By the way, there's a meeting this
afternoon. You coming?
TODD
(blase)
I guess.
Neil puts down his play and looks at Todd.
NEIL
None of what Mr. Keating has to say
means shit to you, does it?
TODD
W(cid:13) hat is that supposed to mean?
NEIL
Being in the club means being
stirred up by things. You look
about as stirred up as a cesspool.
TODD
You want me out... is that what
you're saying?
NEIL
No, I want you in. But being in
means you gotta do something. Not
just say you're in.

TODD
(turns angrily)
Listen Neil, I appreciate your
interest in me but I'm not like
you. When you say things, people
pay attention. People follow you.
I'm not like that.
NEIL
Why not? Don't you think you could
be?
TODD
No! I don't know, I'll probably
never know. The point is, there's
nothing you can do about it so butt
out, all right? I can take care of
myself just fine. All right?
NEIL
Er... No.
TODD
No? What do you mean 'no'?
NEIL
(shrugs matter-of-factly)
No.
Neil opens his play. Todd waits for Neil to relent. He
doesn't.
EXT. CAVE - AFTERNOON
The boys enter the cave.
INT. THE CAVE - AFTERNOON
It is a clear, crisp fall afternoon. Charlie, Knox, Todd,
Necks, Neil, Cameron, and Pitts sit around. Neil recites
from Thoreau.
NEIL
"I went to the woods because I
wished to live deliberately. I
wanted to live deep and suck out
all the marrow of life."
KNOX
(moans)
God, I want to suck all the marrow
out of Chris. I'm so in love, I
feel like I'm going to die!

NEIL
You know what the dead poets would
say: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye
may..."
KNOX
But she's in love with: the moron
son of my father's best friend.
What would the dead poets say about
that?
K(cid:13) nox walks away from the group. Despair is washing over him.
CHARLIE
I feel like I've never been alive.
For years I've been risking
nothing. I have no idea what I am
or what I want to do! Neil, you
know you want to act. Knox wants
Chris.
KNOX
Needs Chris! Must have Chris!
CHARLIE
Meeks, you're the brain here. What
do the dead poets say about
somebody like me?
MEEKS
The romantics were passionate
experimenters, Charles. They
dabbled in many things before
settling, if ever.
CAMERON
There aren't too many places to be
an experimenter at Welton, Meeks.
Charlie paces a moment, then gets an idea. He addresses the
group.
CHARLIE
I hereby declare this the Charles
Dalton Cave for Passionate
Experimentation. In the future,
anyone wishing entry must have
permission from me.
PITTS
Wait a minute, Charlie. This
should belong to the club.

Seize the cave.
Charlie grins. The boys look at each other and shake their
heads. Neil heads out.
NEIL
I gotta get to the tryouts. Wish
me luck.
MEEKS
Good luck.
Neil exits. Charlie finds a rock and begins carving his name
on a wall of the cave. Pitts shakes his head.
EXT. SOCCER FIELD - AFTERNOON
Gusts of wind blow across the field. About 50 boys stand in
their sweats, moving around, trying to keep warm. Among them
are Todd, Charlie, Pitts, and Knox who is in a state of
lovesick despair. Keating walks up, carrying same soccer
balls under one arm and a case under the other.
PITTS
Say, look who's the soccer
instructor.
KEATING
Here here, there are quite a few of
us so we have to be quiet if we're
to get anything accomplished. Who
h(cid:13) as the roll?
SENIOR STUDENT
I do, sir.
SENIOR STUDENT
Keating takes the three-page roll
and examines it.
KEATING

Keating glances at Todd. Todd doesn't know what to say.
KEATING
Hmmmm. Watson?
(no answer)
Richard Watson? Absent too, eh?
SOMEONE
Watson's sick, sir.
KEATING
Hmm. Sick indeed. I suppose I
should give Watson demerits. But
if I give Watson demerits, I will
also have to give Perry demerits
and I like Perry.
He crumples the roll up and tosses it away.
KEATING
Boys, you don't have to be here if
you don't want to. Anyone who
wants to play, follow me.
Keating marches off. Astonished and delighted by this
capriciousness, most of the boys excitedly follow.
EXT. NEW ANGLE - FAR SOCCER FIELD - LATER
Most of the boys from earlier sit on the ground. Keating
stands before them.
KEATING
Devotees may argue that one game or
sport is inherently better than
another. For me the most important
thing in all sport is the way other
human beings can push us to excel.
Plato, a gifted man like myself,
said, "Only the contest made me a
poet, a sophist, an orator." Each
person take a slip of paper and
line up single file.
He passes out slips of paper to the curious students.
EXT. THE SOCCER FIELD - LATER
The boys form a long line. Todd stands listlessly at the
rear. Ten feet in front of the boy at the head of the line,
a soccer ball rests on the ground.

KEATING
You know what to do... Now go!
McAllister walks past the soccer field. He watches in
fascination as the boy at the head of the line steps out and
r(cid:13) eads loudly from his slip of paper.
FIRST BOY
"Oh to struggle against great odds,
To meet enemies undaunted!"
He runs and kicks the ball at the goal, missing. Keating
puts down another ball, then puts a record on a portable
record player. Classical music starts. The second boy,
Knox, steps out.
KEATING
Rhythm, boy! Rhythm is important.
SECOND BOY (KNOX)
"To be entirely alone with them, to
find out how much one can stand!"
Knox too runs and kicks the ball. Just before he smashes it
with his foot, he yells: "CHET!" ball. Keating puts down
another ball
THIRD BOY (MEEKS)
"To look strife, torture, prison,
popular odium face to face!"
Meeks runs and kicks the ball with great intent. Next,
Charlie steps out and reads.
CHARLIE
To indeed be a God!
With determination, Charlie kicks the ball through the goal.
McAllister smiles and walks on.
INT. NEIL AND TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT
Todd sits at his desk, a half-composed poem before him. He
adds a line, then breaks the pencil in frustration. He
paces, sighs, then picks up another pencil and tries to
again.
INT. THE DORM HALLWAY - SAME
Neil enters, looking stunned.

Hey, I'm Puck!
VOICE FROM A ROOM
"Puck" you! Pipe down.
CHARLIE AND OTHERS
All right, Neil. Congratulations!
INT. NEIL AND TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT
Neil enters and closes the door. Incredibly excited, he
pulls out an old typewriter and begins to type. Todd
watches.
TODD
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
NEIL
Sssh. That's what I'm taking care
of. They need a letter of
p(cid:13) ermission.
TODD
From you?
NEIL
From my father and Nolan.
TODD
Neil, you're not gonna...
NEIL
Quiet. I have to think. Neil
mumbles lines from the play,
giggles to himself, then keeps
typing.
Todd shakes his head in disbelief.
INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
Knox stands before class reading the poem he wrote.
KNOX
"I see a sweetness in her smile
Bright light shines from her eyes
But life is complete: contentment mine
Just knowing that she --
Knox stops. He lowers his paper.

KNOX
I'm sorry. It's stupid. Knox walks
back to his seat.
KEATING
It's fine, Knox. Good effort.
(to the class)
What Knox has done demonstrates an
important point, not only in
writing poetry, but in every
endeavor. That is, deal with the
important things in life love,
beauty, truth, justice.
Keating paces.
KEATING
And don't limit poetry to the word.
Poetry can be found in a work of
art, music, a photograph, in the
way a meal is prepared -- anything
with the stuff of revelation in it.
It can exist in the most everyday
things but it must never, never be
ordinary. By all means, write
about the sky or a girl's smile but
when you do, let your poetry
conjure up salvation day, doomsday,
any day, I don't care, as long as
it enlightens us, thrills us and --
if it's inspired -- makes us feel a
bit immortal.
MEEKS
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there
poetry in math?
Chuckles from the class.
KEATING
Absolutely, Mr. Dalton, there is
elegance in mathematics. If
everyone wrote poetry, the planet
would starve, for God's sake. But
there must be poetry -- and we must
stop to notice it -- in even the
simplest acts of living, or we will
have wasted the truly wonderful
opportunity that life as human
beings offers us. That said, who
wants to recite next? Come on.
I'll get to everyone eventually.

K(cid:13) eating looks around. No one volunteers. Keating grins.
KEATING
Look at Mr. Anderson. In such
agony. Step up, lad, and let's put
you out of your misery.
All eyes are on Todd. He is dying inside. He stands and
walks slowly to the front of the class like a condemned man
on his way to his execution.
KEATING
Todd, have you prepared your poem?
Todd shakes his head no.
KEATING
Mr. Anderson believes that
everything he has inside of him is
worthless and embarrassing.
Correct, Todd? Isn't that your
fear?
Todd nods jerkedly yes.
KEATING
Then today you will see that what
is inside of you is worth a great
deal.
Keating strides to the blackboard. Rapidly, he writes: "I
SOUND MY BARBARIC YAWP? OVER THE ROOFTOPSOF THE WORLD." --
Walt Whitman.
KEATING
A yawp, for those who don't know,
is a loud cry or yell. Todd, I
would like you to give us a
demonstration of a barbaric yawp.
TODD
(barely audible)
A yawp?
KEATING
A barbaric yawp.
Keating pauses, then suddenly moves fiercely at Todd.

YAWP!
KEATING
LOUDER!
TODD
AHHHHHH!
KEATING
All right! Very good! There's a
barbarian in there after all!
Keating claps. The class claps too. Todd, red-faced, swells
a bit.
KEATING
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman
over the door. What does he remind
you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't
think about it.
TODD
A madman.
KEATING
A madman. Perhaps he was. What
kind of madman? Don't think!
Answer.
TODD
A crazy madman.
KEATING
Use your imagination! First thing
that pops to your mind, even if
i(cid:13) t's gibberish!
TODD
A... A... sweaty-toothed madman.
KEATING
Now there's the poet speaking!
Close your eyes and think of the
picture. Describe what you see.

KEATING
(prompting)
A sweaty-toothed madman...
TODD
A sweaty-toothed madman with a
stare that pounds my brain.
KEATING
Excellent! Have him act. Give it
rhythm!
TODD
His hands reach out and choke me
All the time he mumbles slowly.
Truth... Truth is like a blanket
that always leaves your feet cold.
This brings chuckles from the class. This angers Todd.
KEATING
To hell with them, most about the
blanket!
Todd opens his eyes and addresses the class in defiant
cadence.
TODD
Stretch it, pull it, it will never
cover any of us. Kick at it, beat
at it, it will never be enough...
KEATING
Don't stop!
TODD
(struggling, but getting
it out)
From the moment we enter crying to
the moment we leave dying,
It will cover just your head as you
wail and cry and scream!
Todd stands still for a long time. Both he and the students
have felt the magic or what has just taken place. Neil
starts applauding. Others join in. Todd swells and, for the
first time, there is a hint of confidence in him. The
applause stops. Keating walks to Todd.

EXT. THE SOCCER FIELD - DAY
A soccer ball careens off a kicking foot. Beethoven's Ninth
symphony, fourth movement, "Ode To Joy," blares forth.
Keating stands on the sidelines beside his portable record
player, watching the boys play soccer, waving his arms like
an orchestra conductor.
In front of Keating, the boys play soccer to this spectacular
music. They run, kick, pass, fall, block, head, dribble,
take -- all to the overpowering chorus of one of the most
i(cid:13) nspirational pieces of music ever written.
EXT. DEAD POETS CAVE - AFTERNOON
Boys enter the cave.
INT. DEAD POETS CAVE - AFTERNOON
Neil hurries in carrying a small, broken statue. The other
pledges of the Dead Poets Society are assembled around
Charlie who sits silently cross-legged before them. His eyes
are closed and, in one hand, he holds an old saxophone.
NEIL
Look at this.
PITTS
What is it?
NEIL
The god of the cave.
The statue has a stake sticking cut of its head with a candle
stuck in it. Neil plants the statue in ground and lights the
candle. It illuminates a red and blue drummer boy, face
pitted from exposure, yet noble in its visage. Charlie, who
hasn't moved, clears his throat. All turn to him and settle
in.
CHARLIE
Gentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles
Dalton.
He blows scattered notes on the saxophone. Random, blaring,
they sound like bad John Cage. Suddenly Charlie stops.
CHARLIE

Laughing, cCrHyAiRnLgI,E (tCuOmNbTl'iDn)g,

He plays more notes on the sax, then:
CHARLIE
(more rapid than before)
Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming,
crying, flying, gotta be more!!
Gotta be more!!
Charlie plays a simple but absolutely gorgeous melody. The
skeptical looks on the faces of the boys disappear. As
Charlie gets lost in the music, so do the others. The melody
ends with a long, beautiful, haunting note.
NEIL
Charlie, That was great! Where did
you learn to play like that?
CHARLIE
My parents made me take clarinet
but I hated it.
(putting on a mock British
accent)
The sax is more sonorous.
K(cid:13) nox stands. He backs away, full of torment and frustration.
KNOX
God, I can't take it anymore! If I
don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
CHARLIE
Knox, you gotta calm down.
KNOX
No, I've been calm all my life! If
I don't do something, it's gonna
kill me.
NEIL
Where are you going?
KNOX
I'm calling her!

CHRIS
Hello?
INT. THE DORM PHONE ROOM/STAIRWELL - AFTERNOON
Knox hears Chris' voice. He starts to speak, then hangs up
the phone.
KNOX
She's gonna hate me! The Danburrys
will hate me. My parents will kill
me!
He looks at the faces of the others. No one says a word.
KNOX
All right, goddamn it, you're
right! "Carpe diem" even if it
kills me.
He picks up the phone and dials again.
INT. CHRIS' HOUSE - SAME
Again the phone rings. Again Chris enters and answers.

Friday night. Thank you, Chris.
He hangs up the phone. He is thunderstruck. He lets out a
yelp.
KNOX

call me! She invited me to a party
with her!
CHARLIE
At Chet Danburry's house.
KNOX

CHARLIE
What is the point?
KNOX
The point is she was thinking about
me! I've only met her once and
already she's thinking about me.
Damn it, it's gonna happen! I feel
it. She's going to be mine!
He exits the phone room, his head in a cloud. The others
look at each other, not sure what to think.
EXT. THE HENDLY HALL AUDITOMUM - DAY
The buildings at this school are white brick. Neil parks his
bicycle and enters the auditorium.
INT. THE AUDITORIUM STAGE - LATER
High school actors are on stage rehearsing Shakespeare's "A
Midsummer Night's Dream." Neil stands center stage, playing
Puck. He holds a stick with a bell accoutered jester's head
on one end of it.
NEIL (AS PUCK)
"Yet but three? Come one more.
Two of both kinds makes up four.
Here she comes, curst and sad.
Cupid is a knavish lad
Thus to make poor females mad."
Enter Ginny Danburry playing Hermia, crawling on stage,
looking exhausted. As she starts her lines, the DIRECTOR of
the play, a woman in her 40s, interrupts.
DIRECTOR
Good, Neil. I really get the
feeling your Puck knows he's in
charge. Remember that he takes
g(cid:13) reat delight in what he's doing.

As Ginny re-enters and starts her lines...
GINNY (AS HERMIA)
"Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew, and torn
with briars I can no further crawl,
no further go."
EXT. THE WELTON DORMS - NIGHT
Neil rides up on his bike and parks it. As he starts into
the dorm, he spots a figure sitting motionless on a wall.
NEIL
Todd?
Neil walks over to get a better look. It is Todd, sitting in
the dark without a coat.
NEIL
What's going on?
Todd doesn't answer.
NEIL
Todd, what's the matter?
TODD
It's my birthday.
NEIL
It is? Happy Birthday. You get
anything?
Todd is motionless. Then he points to a box. Neil looks. In
the box seems to be the monogrammed desk set that we've seen
on Todd's desk.
NEIL
This is your desk set.
(pause)
I don't get it.
TODD
They gave me the exact same thing
as last year!

another one. Maybe they thought...
TODD
Maybe they don't think at all
unless it's about my brother! His
birthday's always a big to-do.
(pause: looks at the desk
set)
The stupid thing is, I didn't even
like the first one.
He puts the desk set down.
NEIL
Look, Todd, you're obviously under-
estimating the value of this desk
set.
TODD
what?
NEIL
I mean, this is one special gift!
Who would want a football or a
baseball bat or a car when they
could get a desk set as wonderful
as this one!
TODD
Yeah! And just look at this ruler!
T(cid:13) hey laugh. A silence falls.
TODD
(thoughtful)
You know what Dad called me when I
was growing up? "Five ninty-
eight." That's what all the
chemicals in the human body would
be worth if you bottled them raw
and sold them. He told me that was
all I'd ever be worth unless I
worked every day to improve myself.
"Five ninety- eight."

TODD
When I was little, I thought all
parents automatically loved their
kids. That's what my teachers told
me. That's what I read in the
books they gave me. That's what I
believed. Well, my parents might
have loved my brother but they did
not love me.
He takes a deep, anguished breath. Neil is groping for
something to say. Todd walks into the dorm.
EXT. A WELTON BRICK COURTYARD - DAY
The class pours into the courtyard expectantly. Another
Keating stunt? Keating addresses them.
KEATING
People, I am delighted with your
progress as reflected in your
essays and poems. However, I know
the school policy is to encourage
study groups and I believe that a
dangerous though inevitable element
of conformity has been seeping into
your work. Misters Pitts, Cameron,
Overstreet, and Chapman line up
please over here.
Keating indicates for the four boys to stand near him.
KEATING
On the count of four, begin walking
together around the courtyard.
Nothing to think about. No grade
here. One, two, three, go.
The boys begin walking. They go down one side of the
courtyard, across the back, up the other side, then across
the front.
KEATING
That's the way. Please continue.
As the boys walk around the courtyard again, they begin to
walk together in step. Soon it becomes like a march,
producing a one-two-three-four cadence. Keating begins to
c(cid:13) lap.

ANGLE THROUGH A WINDOW
McAllister sits in his empty classroom, reading a book. He
sees the commotion in the courtyard and watches.
ANGLE FROM ABOVE
The marching boys get into it. The class joins in clapping.
Soon the tour boys are marching vigorously to the rhythmic
clapping of the entire class.
NEW ANGLE
Inside his second-story office, Nolan is looking out his
window at the marching boys below.
ANGLE ON KEATING
KEATING
All right, stop. You way have
noticed how at the beginning Mister
Overstress and Pitts: seemed to
have a different stride than the
others, but soon they were all
walking in the same cadence. Our
encouragement made it even more
marked. Now this experiment was
not to single out Pitts or
Overstress. What it demonstrates
is how difficult it is for any of
us to listen to our own voice or
maintain our own beliefs in the
presence of others. If any of you
believe you would have marched
differently, then ask yourself why
you participated in the clapping.
Lads, there is a great need in all
of us to be accepted. However,
that need can be like a nasty
current, whisking us away unless
we're strong and determined
swimmers. Don't insist on the
separate path simply to be
different or contrary, but trust
what is unique about yourselves
even if it's odd or unpopular. As

diverged in a wood, and I...

A bell rings, signifying the end of class. Keating walks

ANGLE ON NOLAN IN HIS OFFICE
Nolan moves away from the window. ANGLE ON McALLISTER IN HIS
CLASSROOM Amused at Keating's antics, he turns back to his
book.
INT. ENTRANCE TO THE DEAD POETS CAVE - NIGHT
Todd, Neil, Cameron, Pitts, and Meeks sit around. A fog has
moved in and the trees sway in the breeze.
MEEKS
Where's Knox?
PITTS
Getting ready for that party.
CAMERON
What about Charlie? He's the one
who insisted on this meeting.
NEIL
I went to the woods because I
wanted to live deliberately. To
live deep and suck out all the
marrow of life...
In the woods there is a noise: the sound of girls' laughter.
GIRL'S VOICE
I can't see a thing.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
It's just over here.
Charlie and TWO GIRLS arrive at the cave. One is pretty, the
other is plain. The girls are about 20, blonde, beers in
their hands. They aren't the type to be seriously interested
in Charlie or the other boys. They're just here for a good
time.
CHARLIE
Hey guys, meet Gloria and...
PLAIN GIRL (TINA)
Tina.

CHARLIE
Tina and Gloria, this is the pledge
class of the Dead Poets Society.
GLORIA
It's such a strange name! Won't
you tell us what it means?
CHARLIE
I told you, that's a secret.
GLORIA
Isn't he precious?
Gloria gives Charlie an affectionate hug. The other members
or the club are flabbergasted. These girls are wild, exotic
creatures, the kind whose unashamed love of men causes young
boys' hearts to come to rest in young boys' throats. The
girls giggle.
TINA
I can't call you Charlie anymore?
(puts her arm around
Charlie)
What does Numama mean, honey?
(cid:13) CHARLIE
It's Nuwanda, and I made it up.
GLORIA
I'm cold.
Charlie puts his arm around Gloria.
MEEKS
Let's build a fire.
Charlie shoots Meeks a look. As the boys move off to gather
wood, Charlie scrapes some mud off the wall of the cave and
wipes it on his face like an Indian brave. Meek shoots
Gloria his sexiest stare, then goes off with the other boys.
The girls whisper and giggle together.
EXT. THE DANBURRY HOUSE - NIGHT
Knox parks his bicycle along the side of the house. He takes
off his overcoat, and stuffs it in the bike saddle bag. He
straightens his tie, then goes to the front door. He knocks.
He can hear music inside. He knocks again. Finally, since
no one comes to the door, Knox opens it.

INT. THE DANBURRY HOUSE - SAME
Knox enters. "Open the Door to Your Heart" by Darrell Banks
is playing on the Hi-Fi. On the entrance hall couch is a
couple, making out like crazy. Up and down the stairs are
other couples doing the same. Knox stands there, not knowing
what to do. Momentarily, Chris walks through, her hair an
uncombed mass.
KNOX
Chris!
Chris turns and sees Knox.
CHRIS
Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did
you bring anybody?
KNOX
No.
CHRIS
Ginny Danburry's here. Look for
her.
KNOX
But, Chris...
CHRIS
I gotta find Chet. Make yourself
at home.
She exits. Knox watches her. He slumps in dejection.
EXT. THE WOODS AROUND THE CAVE
Charlie is gathering wood. Neil, Pitts, Todd and the other
boys surround him.
NEIL
Charlie...
CHARLIE
It's Nuwanda.
NEIL
Nuwanda, what is going on?
CHARLIE
Nothing, unless you object to
h(cid:13) aving girls here.
(cid:13)
(cid:13)

(cid:13)

PITTS
Well, of course not. It's just
that... You could have warned us.
CHARLIE
I thought I'd be spontaneous. I
mean, that's the point of this
whole thing, isn't it?
NEIL
Where'd you find them?
CHARLIE
They were walking along the fence
past the soccer field. Said they
were curious about the school so I
invited them to the meeting.
CAMERON
Do they go to Henley Hall?
CHARLIE
I don't think they're in school.
CAMERON
They're townies?!
CHARLIE
Cameron, what is the matter with
you. You act like they're your
mother or something. You afraid of
them?
CAMERON
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them
just, if we get caught with them,
we're dead.
GLORIA (O.S.)
Say, what's going on out there?
CHARLIE
Just gathering wood.
(low, to Cameron)
You just keep your mouth shut,
jerkoff, and there's nothing to
worry about.
CAMERON
Watch who you call a jerkoff.
NEIL
Oh calm down, Cameron.
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)

(cid:13)
(cid:13)

(cid:13)

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
68.
Charlie gives Cameron an expression of mock fear, then heads
off. The others follow. Cameron watches Charlie and Neil
for a moment, then walks after them.
INT. THE DANBURRY PANTRY - NIGHT
Knox, looking suicidal, wanders through the crowded party and
ends up in the pantry. Kids stand talking. A couple in the
corner is involved in a long kiss. His hand keeps wandering
to her knee and her hand keeps pushing his away, yet the kiss
never breaks. This happens over and over through the entire
next scene.
Ginny Danburry is in the corner and she and Knox exchange
smiles. At the sink a guy stands making bourbon and Cokes.
The guy eyes Knox.
GUY
You Mutt Sanders' brother?
K(cid:13) nox shakes his head no.
GUY
Bubba...
BUBBA is a big, drunk jock leaning on the refrigerator.
GUY
This guy look like Mutt Sanders?
BUBBA
You his brother?
KNOX
No relation. Never heard of him.
Sorry.
BUBBA
Say Steve, where's your manners?
Here's Mutt's brother and you don't
offer him a drink? Want some
bourbon?
KNOX
Actually I don't...
Steve puts a glass in Knox's hand and fills it with bourbon,
adding only a hint of Coke. Bubba clinks the glass with him.
BUBBA
To Mutt.
(cid:13)

STEVE
To Mutt.
KNOX
To Mutt.
Bubba and Steve drain their glasses. Knox follows their
lead, then bursts into a coughing fit. Steve pours everyone
more bourbon.
BUBBA
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
KNOX
(coughing fitfully)
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
BUBBA
(toasting)
To fucking Mutt.
STEVE
To fucking Mutt.
KNOX
Fucking Mutt...
They drain their glasses again. Knox continues coughing.
BUBBA
Well, I'd better find Patsy.
(slaps Knox on the back)
Say hello to Mutt for me.
KNOX
Will do.
Knox and Ginny exchange knowing smiles. Bubba leaves Knox,
who is still coughing. Ginny wanders out. Steve pours him
and Knox more bourbon.
INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT
The boys have lit a fire and the girls are warming their
hands. The candle on the head of the "cave god" FLUTTERS.
Tina notices the pitted statue.
TINA
I heard you guys were weird but not
this weird.
(cid:13) (cid:13)
(cid:13) (cid:13)

She takes out a pint of whiskey and offers some to Neil. He
takes it and sips. He obviously hasn't had much whiskey in
his life but he tries to act like he has. He hands it back.
TINA
Go ahead, pass it around.
Neil does. It goes from boy to boy. Each boy tries to act
like he likes the terrible bitterness he tastes. Unlike most
of the others, Todd manages to keep from coughing as he
s(cid:13) wallows the whiskey. Everyone is impressed.
GLORIA
(to Todd)
Yeah!
(to the others)
Don't you guys miss having girls
here?
CHARLIE
Miss it? It drives us crazy.
That's part of what this club is
about. In fact, I'd like to
announce that I've published an
article in the school paper, in the
name of the Dead Poets society,
demanding girls be admitted to
Welton, so we can all stop beating
off.
NEIL
You what?! How did you do that?
CHARLIE
I'm one of the proofers. I slipped
the article in.
PITTS
Oh God, it's over now!
CHARLIE
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
PITTS
Don't you think they'll figure out
who did it?! Don't you know
they'll come to you and demand to
know what the Dead Poets Society
is? Charlie, you had no right to
do something like that!
CHARLIE
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
(cid:13) (cid:13)

GLORIA
(putting her arm around
Charlie)
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
CHARLIE
And are we just playing around out
here or do we mean what we say? If
all we do is come and read a bunch
of poems to each other, what the
hell are we doing?
NEIL
You still shouldn't have done it,
Charlie. You don't speak for the
club.
CHARLIE
Hey, would you not worry about your
precious little necks? If they
catch me, I'll tell them I made it
up. All your asses are safe.
Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come
here to listen to us argue. Are we
gonna have a meeting or what?
GLORIA
Yeah, how do we know if we want to
join if you don't have a meeting?
NEIL
(casts a surprised lock at
Charlie)
Join?
Charlie ignores this. He turns to Tina.
CHARLIE
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's
day? Thou art more lovely and more
temperate..."
In his recital, Charlie has aimed these words directly at
T(cid:13) ina. She melts into warm goo.
TINA
Oh, that's so sweet!
Tina hugs Charlie. The other boys look at each other, trying
unsuccessfully to hide their incredible jealousy.
CHARLIE
I wrote that for you.
(cid:13) (cid:13)
(cid:13) (cid:13)

(cid:13) (cid:13)
(cid:13) (cid:13)
72.
TINA
You did?
CHARLIE
I'll write one for you too, Gloria.
(closes his eyes then)
"She walks in beauty like the
night.."
Charlie's eyes open. He has forgotten the words to this
poem. Covering, he walks across the cave.
CHARLIE
"She walks in beauty like the
night..."
Charlie turns his back, opens a book, and reads quickly to
himself. He closes it, puts the bock down, and turns back to
Gloria.
CHARLIE
"Of cloudless climes and starry
skies; All that's best of dark and
bright; Meet in her aspect and her
eyes."
Gloria squeals with delight.
GLORIA
Isn't he wonderful?!
The other boys are absolutely appalled, but desperately
jealous that Charlie is getting away with this. Gloria hugs
Charlie.
INT. THE DANBURRY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Music by the Drifters is playing loudly. Every light in the
room is out. The only illumination is moonlight through the
windows. Only after our eyes get adjusted to the dark can we
see that the room is filled with couples making out. Knox,
carrying another drink and looking tipsy, enters. He walks a
bit, then trips over a couple on the floor.
ANGRY GUY'S VOICE
Hey!
KNOX
Sorry.
Knox falls onto the sofa. To his left sit a couple making
out heavily. Their breathing is like that of some giant
beast. To Knox's right is another couple, making out too.
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)

(cid:13) (cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
73.
Knox tries to get up but the couple he tripped aver has now
rolled against his shins, pinning him. Knox tries to get
comfortable in his little spot on the sofa. The music stops.
The room sounds like an artificial respiration ward. The
couple to Knox's right look and sound as if they are going to
chew each other's lips off. Knox glances at the couple to
h(cid:13) is left. He hears:
BOY'S VOICE
Oh Chris, you're so beautiful.
The couple are Chris and Chet. Chris is sitting right next
to Knox. Music starts again. It's "This Magic Moment" by
the Drifters. Chris and Chet continue petting heavily. Knox
tries to look away but can't keep his eyes off Chris.
CHET
Chris, you are so gorgeous.
Chet kisses Chris hard and she leans against Knox. In the
moonlight-filled room, Knox sees the outline of Chris' face,
the nape of her neck, the curves of her breasts. He downs
the rest of his drink and tries to look away.
KNOX
Oh my God help me.
Chris obliviously continues to lean against Knox. Knox is
struggling with temptation -- trying not to even look -- but
he's losing. Suddenly, he turns and looks at Chris again.
Every rational thing inside of him says "no" but his emotions
are saying "yes."
KNOX
(to himself)
Carpe breastum. Seize the breast.
CHRIS
(to Chet)
Huh?
CHET
I didn't say anything.
Chet and Chris continue to kiss. As though his hand were
being drawn by a magnet too powerful to resist, Knox's hand
reaches out and begins to ever so lightly stroke the nape of
Chris' neck down toward her breast. Chris obviously thinks
that the hand is Chet's and she lets it continue. Knox moves
his hand up and down her, sensuously. He closes his eyes,
breathing heavily.
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13) (cid:13)

CHRIS
(in the dark)
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous...
CHET
(in the dark)
It does?
(pause)
What?
CHRIS
(in the dark)
You know...
Knox pulls his hand away. Chet thinks a moment, then kisses
Chris again.
CHRIS
(in the dark)
Don't stop.
CHET
(in the dark)
S(cid:13) top what?
CHRIS
(in the dark)
Chet...
Knox puts his hand back on Chris' neck. Again he starts
rubbing her, ever so gently, moving down toward her breast.
CHRIS
(in the dark)
Oh... oh...
We can see Chet's silhouette pausing over Chris, trying to
figure out what she is talking about. Giving up, he goes
back to kissing her. Chris continues to show her pleasure.
Knox leans his head back on the sofa and his breathing
becomes heavy.
The music builds. Unable to resist, he rubs Chris' chest,
getting dangerously close to her breast. Chris is breathing
hard. Knox is slipping into ecstasy. His drink falls out of
his hand.
Suddenly Chet's hand grabs Knox's hand and a lamp light
flicks on. Knox is face to face with a furious Chet and a
confused Chris.
CHET
What are you doing?!
(cid:13)
(cid:13) (cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)

(cid:13)
75.
CHRIS
Knox?!
KNOX
(feigning surprise)
Chet! Chris! What are you doing
here?
CHET
Why you...
Chet smashes Knox in the face with his fist. Chet grabs Knox
by the shirt, throws him to the floor, and jumps on him. He
begins swinging at Knox's face which Knox is doing his best
to protect.
CHET
You fucked up little prick!
CHRIS
(beginning to feel sorry
for Knox)
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Chet's fists hit Knox over and over.
CHRIS
Chet, stop! He didn't mean
anything.
She pushes Chet off. Knox rolls over, holding his face.
CHRIS
That's enough!
Chet stands over Knox, who is holding his bloody nose and
bruised face.
KNOX
I'm sorry, Chris. I'm sorry!
CHET
You want some more, you little son
of a bitch? Huh?! Get the hell
out of here!!
He moves at Knox again, but Chris and some others hold him
b(cid:13) ack. Others lead Knox out of the room.
KNOX
(drunk)
Chris, I'm sorry!
(cid:13)
(cid:13)

CHET
Next time I see you, you're dead!
INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT
The fire casts warm light on the wall of the cave. Gloria
sits with her arm around Charlie, staring adoringly. The
bottle passes between Tina and the others.
CHARLIE
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina
the Dead Poets garden?
MEEKS
Garden?
PITTS
What garden?
Charlie silently motions with his eyes for Pitts and the
others to vamoose. Neil elbows Pitts and makes a motion
outside with his head. Suddenly Pitts gets it.
PITTS
Oh. Right. That garden. Come on,
guys.
The boys head out with Tina.
TINA
This is so strange! You guys even
have a garden?
Meeks stands in the cave, still not getting it.
MEEKS
What are you guys talking about?
All of the others are gone. Meeks looks at Charlie, who
stares daggers at him.
MEEKS
Charles, uh, Nuwanda, we don't have
a garden.
Neil comes back in and pulls Meeks out. Charlie waits for
them to go.
CHARLIE
(to Gloria)
God, for a smart guy, he's so
stupid.

Gloria stares into Charlie's eyes. Charlie smiles.
GLORIA
I think he's sweet.
CHARLIE
I think you're sweet.
Charlie looks at her. He closes his eyes and leans slowly in
to kiss her. Just as he is about to, she stands.
GLORIA
You know what really excites me
about you?
CHARLIE
(blinking)
What?
GLORIA
Every guy that I meet wants me for
one thing my body. You're not like
that.
CHARLIE
I'm not?
GLORIA
No! Anybody else would have jumped
my bones by now but you're after my
soul. Make me up some more poetry.
CHARLIE
But...
(cid:13) GLORIA
Please! It's so wonderful to be
appreciated for my mind!
She gets up and starts pacing. Charlie puts his hand over
his face. Gloria turns and looks at him.
GLORIA
Nuwanda? Please?
CHARLIE
All right! I'm thinking!
(pause)
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments; love is not love

Gloria emits sensual moans.
GLORIA
Don't stop.
CHARLIE
(more and more rapidly and
punctuated by Gloria's
moans)
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never
shaken; It is the star to every
wandering bark whose worth's
unknown, although his height be
taken."
GLORIA
This is better than sex any day.
This is romance!
As a frustrated Charlie continues reciting...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WELTON ACADEMY CHAPEL - DAY
There is a buzz in the student body as they move to their
seats, passing school newspapers amongst themselves. Knox's
face is marked with bruises. Neil, Todd, Pitts, Necks,
Cameron and especially Charlie's faces are marked with
exhaustion. Pitts hands Charlie a briefcase.
PITTS
(low)
All set.
Charlie nods. Mr. Nolan enters. All put away the newspapers
and stand. Nolan strides to the podium and motions for
everyone to sit. All obey.
NOLAN
In this week's issue of Walter
Honor, there appeared an
unauthorized and profane article
about the need for girls at Welton.
Rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty parties --
and let me assure you I will find
them -- I am asking any and all
students who know anything about
this article to make themselves
known here and now.

Whoever theN OgLuAiNl(tCyO NpTe'rDs)ons are,
this is your only chance to avoid
(cid:13) expulsion from this school.
Suddenly, somewhere in the room there is the sound of a
TELEPHONE RINGING. Charlie briskly lifts the briefcase into
his lap and opens it. Inside the briefcase is a ringing
telephone. Everyone in assembly is astounded. No one has
ever done something this outrageous here. Charlie,
undaunted, seemingly serious, answers the phone.
CHARLIE (INTO PHONE)
(for all to hear)
Welton Academy, hello? Yes, he is,
just a moment. Mr. Nolan, it's for
you.
NOLAN
What?!
Charlie places the receiver back to his ear.
CHARLIE (INTO PHONE)
It is? You do? I'll tell him.
Mr. Nolan, it's God. He says we
should have girls at Welton.
There is a blast of laughter from the students. On stage
with the teachers, Keating is surprised and amused, but
worried. He and McAllister exchange concerned looks. Blood
red, furious, Nolan strides down the aisle to Charlie. He
sweeps the phone off of Charlie's lap.
NOLAN
I will not be mocked, Mr. Dalton!
He takes Charlie by the arm and jerks him out of the
assembly. Keating watches with concern.
INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Charlie stands in the middle of the room. Nolan paces
furiously.
NOLAN
Who else was involved in this?
CHARLIE
No one, sir. It was just me. I
did the proofing so I inserted my
article in place of Rob Crane's.

NOLAN
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the
first to try to get thrown out of
this school, think again. Others
have had similar actions and they
have failed just as surely as you
will fail. Bend over and grab your
shins.
Charlie obeys and Nolan produces a paddle. The paddle has
holes drilled in it to speed its progress. Nolan takes off
his jacket and moves behind Charlie.
NOLAN
Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.
He slams the paddle into Charlie's buttocks.
CHARLIE
One...
Nolan swings the paddle again. This time he gets more power
into it. Charlie winces.
CHARLIE
Two...
Nolan delivers and Charlie counts. By the fourth lick, the
pain is so intense that Charlie is barely audible. By the
seventh lick, tears are flowing down Charlie's cheeks. The
ninth and tenth licks have Charlie choking on his words,
speechless. Nolan stops after ten licks.
NOLAN
Do you still insist that this was
your idea and your idea alone?
CHARLIE
(choking back pain)
Yes... sir.
NOLAN
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?
I want names.
CHARLIE
(still in agony)
It's only me, Mr. Nolan. I swear.
I made it up.

NOLAN
If I find that there are others,
Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled
and you will remain enrolled.
Stand up.
Charlie obeys. His face is blood red. He fights back tears
of pain and humiliation.
NOLAN
Welton can forgive, Mr. Dalton,
provided you have the courage to
admit your mistakes. When you are
ready to make your apology to the
entire school, let me know.
INT. THE JUNIOR DORM - AFTERNOON
The boys are milling in their rooms, waiting for Charlie's
return. Someone sees him coming. All pretend to be
studying.
Charlie enters, moving slowly, trying not to show his pain.
As he walks toward his room, Neil, Todd, Knox (bruised face),
Pitts, and Necks approach him.
NEIL
What happened? Were you kicked
o(cid:13) ut?
CHARLIE
(not looking at anyone)
No.
NEIL
What happened?
CHARLIE
I'm supposed to turn everybody in,
apologize to the school and all
will be forgiven.
Charlie heads into his room. The others look at each other.
NEIL
What are you going to do?..
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.

Charlie gives the boys a pregnant look, then goes into his
room and slams his door. Smiles of admiration cross the
boys' faces. Charlie has not been broken.
INT. WELTON CLASSROOM BUILDING - AFTERNOON
Keating walks down the corridor. He is just about to stop
and talk to McAllister when Nolan passes.
NOLAN
Mr. Keating, could we have a word?
INT. KEATING'S EMPTY CLASSROOM - DAY
Keating and Nolan enter. Keating turns on the light. Nolan
looks around.
NOLAN
This was my first classroom, John,
did you know that?
(looks at Keating's desk)
My first desk.
KEATING
I didn't know you taught.
NOLAN
English. Way before your time. It
was hard giving it up, I'll tell
you.
(pause)
I'm hearing rumors, John, of some
unusual teaching methods in your
classroom. I'm not saying they
have anything to do with the Dalton
boy's outburst, but I don't think I
have to warn you that boys his age
are very impressionable.
KEATING
Your reprimand made quite an
impression I'm sure.
NOLAN
(letting this pass)
What was going on in the courtyard
the other day?
KEATING
Courtyard?
NOLAN
Boys marching. Clapping in unison.

KEATING
Oh that. That was an exercise to
prove a point. About the evils of
conformity.
NOLAN
John, the curriculum here is set.
It's proven. It works. If you
question it, what's to prevent them
f(cid:13) rom doing the same?
KEATING
I always thought education was
learning to think for yourself.
NOLAN
(almost laughs)
At these boys' age? Not on your
life! Tradition, John.
Discipline.
(pats Keating on the
shoulder)
Prepare them for college, and the
rest will take care of itself.
Mr. Nolan smiles and leaves. Keating stands, thinking. After
a beat, McAllister sticks his head in the door.
MCALLISTER
I wouldn't worry about the boys
being too conformist if I were you.
KEATING
Why is that?
MCALLISTER
Well, you yourself graduated from
these hallowed halls, did you now?
KEATING
Yes?
MCALLISTER
So if you want to raise a confirmed
atheist, give him a rigid religious
upbringing. Works every time.
Keating stares at McAllister. He suddenly lets cut a laugh.
McAllister smiles, then disappears down the hall.

INT. THE JUNIOR CLASS DORM - AFTERNOON
Boys are walking out on the way to their activities. Keating
enters and approaches Charlie, who is exiting with his
friends.
CHARLIE
(surprised)
Mr. Keating!
KEATING
I don't know what misguided impulse
caused you to pull that ridiculous
stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it
was, I hope you've learned your
lesson.
CHARLIE
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!
What about carpe diem and sucking
all the marrow out of life and all
that?
KEATING
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean
getting the bone stuck in your
throat, Charles. You still have
responsibilities to yourself and
those who care about you.
CHARLIE
But I thought...
KEATING
There is a place for daring and a
place for caution as well, Charles,
and a wise person understands which
one is called for. Getting
expelled from this school is not an
act of wisdom. It's far from
perfect but there are still
o(cid:13) pportunities to be had here.
CHARLIE
Yeah? Like what?
KEATING
Like, if nothing else, the
opportunity to attend my classes,
understand?

CHARLIE
(smiling)
Yes sir.
KEATING
So keep your head about you -- the
lot of you -- understood?
NEIL, TODD, PITTS, MEEKS, CAMERON,
KNOX
Yes, Sir.
Keating gives them a slight smile, then exits.
INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
The boys are seated. Keating walks to the blackboard and in
a big scrawl writes: "COLLEGE."
KEATING
Gentlemen, today we will consider a
skill which I consider
indispensable for getting the most
out of college analyzing books you
haven't read. College will
probably destroy your love for
poetry. Hours of boring analysis,
dissection and criticism will see
to that. College will also expose
you to all manner of literature --
much of it transcendent works of
magic which you must devour; some
of it utter drek which you must
avoid like the plague.
Keating pauses.
KEATING
Suppose you are taking a course
entitled "Modern Novels." All
semester you have been reading
masterpieces such as the touching
Pere Gorier by Balzac and the
moving Fathers and Sons by
Turgenev, but when you receive your
assignment for your final paper,
you discover that you are to write
an essay on the theme of parental
love in The Doubtful Debutante, a
novel -- and I use that term
generously here -- by none other
than the professor himself.
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
86.
Keating looks at the boys with a raised eyebrow, then
continues.
KEATING
After reading the first three pages
of the book, you realize that you
would rather volunteer for combat
than waste your precious earthly
time infecting your mind with this
sewage, but do you despair? Take
an "F." Absolutely not because you
are prepared.
K(cid:13) eating paces.
KEATING
Open The Doubtful Deb and learn
from the jacket that the book is
about Frank, a farm equipment
salesman who sacrifices everything
to provide his social climbing
daughter Christine with the debut
she so desperately desires. Begin
your essay by disclaiming the need
to restate the plot while at the
same time regurgitating enough of
it to convince the professor that
you've read his book. Next shift
to something pretentious and
familiar. For instance, you might
write, "What is remarkable to note
are the similarities between the
author's dire picture of parental
love and modern Freudian theory.
Christine is Electra, her father is
a fallen Oedipus." Finally, skip
to the obscure and elaborate like
this:
Keating pauses, then...
KEATING
"What is most remarkable is the
novel's uncanny connection with
Hindu Indian philosopher Avesh
Rahesh Non. Rahesh Non discussed
in painful detail the discarding of
parents by children for the three
headed monster of ambition, money,
and social success. Go on to
discuss Rahesh Non's theories about
what feeds the monster, how to
behead it, etcetera etcetera.

courage in introducing The Doubtful
Deb to you.
Meeks raises his hand.
MEEKS
Oh Captain, My Captain. What if we
don't know anything about someone
like Rahesh Non?
KEATING
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr.
Meeks. You make him or someone
like him up. No self important
college professor such as this one
would dare admit ignorance of such
an obviously important figure and
you will probably receive a comment
similar to the one I received:
K(cid:13) eating finds a paper on his desk and reads from it:
KEATING
Your allusions to Rahesh Non were
insightful and well presented.
Glad to see that someone besides
myself appreciates this great but
forgotten Eastern master. A plus.
He drops the paper.
KEATING
Gentlemen, analyzing dreadful books
you haven't read will be on your
final exam, so I suggest you
practice on your own. Now for some
traps of college exams. Take cut a
blue book and pencil, boys. This
is a pop quiz.
The boys obey. Keating passes out tests. He sets up a
screen in the front Of the room, then goes to the back of the
room and sets up a slide projector.
KEATING
Big universities are crowded Sodoms
and Gomorrahs filled with those
delectable beasts we see so little
of here: females.

The level oKfE AdTiIsNtGr(aCcOtNiTo'nD )is
dangerously high, but this quit is
designed to prepare you. Let me
warn you, this test will count.
Begin.
The boys begin their tests. Keating puts a slide in the
projector. On the screen in the front of the room appears a
blow-up of a beautiful girl, college age, leaning over to
pick up a pencil. Her figure is quite remarkable, and,
bending over as she is, you can see her panties. The boys
glance up from their tests, then most do a double-take on the
photo.
KEATING
Concentrate on your tests, boys.
You have twenty minutes.
Keating changes the slide. This time we see a beautiful
woman in scanty lingerie (an ad from "Vogue" or a similar
magazine). The boys find it extremely difficult to
concentrate on their tests. The slide show continues with
slide after slide of beautiful women in revealing and
provocative poses, tight blow-ups of naked female Greek
statues, etc. The boys try in vain to take their tests.
K(cid:13) nox writes "Chris, Chris, Chris" over and over on his paper.
DISSOLVE TO:

Boys in heavy-hooded jackets and winter mufflers move from
building to building. The wind blows leaves around in
swirling torrents.
ANGLE ON A PATH where Todd and Neil walk together. Todd
holds a copy of "A Midsummer's Night's Dream." Neil is using

the world. Most people, if they're
lucky, live about half an exciting
life! If I could get the parts, I
could live dozens of lives.
With a theatrical flourish, he runs and leaps onto a wall.
NEIL
To be or net to be, that is the
question! God, for the first time
in my whole life, I feel completely
alive! You have to try it.
Neil jumps down from the wall.
NEIL
You should come to rehearsals. I
know they need people to work the
lights and stuff.
TODD
No thanks.
NEIL
Lots of girls. The girl who plays
Hermia is incredible.
TODD
I'll come to the performance.
NEIL
Chicken shit. Where were we?
TODD
Yea, art thou there?

Neil and Todd have arrived at their dorm. Neil runs in. Todd
shakes his head and walks off.
INT. TODD AND NEIL'S DORM ROOM - DUSK
Neil enters in a whirlwind of excitement, fencing the air
with the Jester's stick. Neil turns and sees his father,
s(cid:13) itting at his desk. Neil is shocked.
NEIL
Father!
MR. PERRY
Neil, you are going to quit this
ridiculous play immediately.
NEIL
Father, I...
Mr. Perry jumps to his feet and pounds his hand on the desk.
MR. PERRY
Don't you dare talk back to me!
It's bad enough that you've wasted
your time with this absurd acting
business. But you deliberately
deceived me!
(paces furiously)
Who put this in your head? How did
you expect to get away with it?
Answer me!
NEIL
Nobody... I thought I'd surprise
you. I've got all As and...
MR. PERRY
Did you really think I wouldn't
find out?! "My niece is in a play
with your son," Mrs. Marks says.
"You must be mistaken," I say. "My
son isn't in a play." You made a
liar out of me, Neil! Now you will
go tomorrow and tell them you are
quitting.

I don't care if the world is coming
to an end tomorrow night, you are
through with that play! Is that
clear? Is that clear!
NEIL
Yes sir.
Mr. Perry stops. He stares hard at his son.
MR. PERRY
I've made great sacrifices to get
you here, Neil. You will not let
me down.
He turns and exits. Neil stands there for a long time. He
goes to his desk, then suddenly begins pounding his fist on
it. He pounds and pounds as tears roll down his face.
INT. THE WELTON DINING ROOM - EVENING
All of the society "pledges" except Neil sit eating. It
could be noticed that the boys -- Charlie, Knox, Todd, Weeks,
and Pitts -- seem to be having difficulty eating. They look
awkward. Old Hager approaches.
HAGER
Mr. Dalton, what is wrong, son?
Are you having difficulty with your
m(cid:13) eal?
CHARLIE
No.
Hager watches the boys.
HAGER
Misters Necks and Overstreet and
Anderson, are you normally left-
handed?
BOYS
No sir.
HAGER
Then why are you eating with your
left hands?
The boys look at each other. Knox speaks for the group:

KNOX
We thought it would be good to
break old habits, sir.
HAGER
What is wrong with old habits, Mr.
Overstreet?
KNOX
They perpetuate mechanical living,
sir. They limit your mind.
HAGER
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry
less about breaking old habits and
more about developing good study
habits. Do you understand?
KNOX
Yes sir.
HAGER
That goes for all of you. Now eat
with your correct hands.
Hager watches. The boys obey. After he moves away, Charlie
switches hands and begins eating with his left hand again.
One by one, the others do the same. Neil enters, looking
solemn and upset. He silently takes his seat at the table.
NEIL
Visit from my father.
TODD
Do you have to quit the play?
NEIL
I don't know.
CHARLIE
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating
about it?
NEIL
What good will that do?

EXT. KEATING'S ROOM - EVENING
Keating's quarters are on the second floor of a dorm, but
they are entered from the outside. Charlie, Todd, Pitts1 and
Neil stand outside the door. Charlie knocks.
NEIL
This is stupid.
CHARLIE
It's better than doing nothing. No
one comes to the door.
NEIL
He's not here.
Charlie tries the door and it opens.
CHARLIE
Let's wait for him.
Charlie goes in.
(cid:13) OTHERS
Charlie! Nuwanda!
Charlie doesn't come out. Curiosity gets the best of the
others, who reluctantly follow Charlie in.
INT. KEATINGS ROOM - SAME
The furniture is simple and spartan and the room looks almost
lonely. The boys stand around looking uncomfortable.
PITTS
(low)
Nuwanda, we shouldn't be in here.
Charlie and the boys survey the room. There is a suitcase on
the floor by the door. A few books lay by the bed. Charlie
walks to the desk.
CHARLIE
Whoa, look at her!
On the desk is a framed picture of a beautiful girl in her
20s. Lying next to the picture is a half-written letter.
Charlie picks it up and reads.

close my eyes and imagine your
radiant smile -- but my poor
imagination is a dim substitute for
you. Oh, how I miss you and
wish...
The other boys have sensed an extra presence in the room.
They back away from Charlie. Suddenly Charlie stops and sees
Mr. Keating.
CHARLIE
Hello!
Keating calmly takes the letter from Charlie and folds it.
KEATING
A woman is a cathedral, boys.
Worship at one every chance you
get.
He opens a drawer.
KEATING
Anything else you'd care to rifle
through, Mr. Dalton?
CHARLIE
I'm sorry. I, we...
Keating puts the letter in the drawer and closes it. Charlie
looks around for help. Neil steps forward.
NEIL
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came
here so I could talk to you about
something.

Damn it, Nuwanda. You idiot.
CHARLIE
(also exiting)
I couldn't stop myself.
Keating can't help but smile to himself. Neil and Mr.
Keating are alone. Neil paces, looking around.
NEIL
Gosh, they don't give you much room
around here, do they?
KEATING
(wryly)
Maybe they don't want worldly
things distracting me from my
teaching.
NEIL
Why do you do it? I mean, with all
this seize-the-day business, I'd
have thought you'd be out seeing
the world or something?
KEATING
Ah, but I am seeing the world,
Neil. The new world. Seeing a
student like you take root and
bloom. It's worth everything.
That's why I came back here. A
place like this needs at least one
teacher like me.

NEIL
Mr. Keating, my father is making me
quit the play at Henley Hall. When
I think about carpe diem and all
that, I feel like I'm in prison! I
mean, I can see his point. We're
not a rich family like Charlie's.
But he's planned the rest of my
life for me and he's never even
asked me what I want!
KEATING
You can't live a life for someone
else, Neil. You can only live for
yourself. Have you told your
father what you just told me? Have
you shown him your passion about
acting?
NEIL
Are you kidding? He'd kill me!
KEATING
Then you're playing a part for him
too, aren't you? A dangerously
self-destructive one.
K(cid:13) eating watches Neil pace anxiously.
KEATING
Neil, I know this seems impossible
but you have to go to your father
and show him what you're feeling.
You have to let him see who you
are. It's your only chance.
NEIL
I know what he'll say. He'll say
that acting is just a whim and that
it's frivolous and that I should
forget about it. He'll tell me how
they're counting on me and to put
it out of my mind "for my own
good."
KEATING
Well, if it's more than a whim,
then you'll have to prove that to
him. You'll have to show him with
your passion and commitment that
it's what you really want to do.

Eighteen! That's two years! What
about the play? The performance is

KEATING
Give your father the benefit of the
doubt. Talk to him. Let him see
who you are.
NEIL
Isn't there an easier way?
KEATING
Not if you're going to stay true to
yourself.
Neil sits there for a long time.
INT. CHARLIE'S CAVE - NIGHT
The boys sit in the candle-lit room. Charlie blows notes on
his saxophone. Knox sits in the corner, mumbling to himself,
working on a love poem to Chris. Todd sits writing something
too. Cameron is studying. Pitts is scratching a quote out
of a book into the wall. Knox looks at his watch.
KNOX
Ten minutes to curfew.
Nobody responds. Knox looks at Todd.
KNOX
What are you writing?
TODD
I don't know. A poem.
KNOX

right, Nuwanda?
Charlie stops blowing on his sax. He thinks a moment about
his answer.
CHARLIE
Absolutely.
He starts blowing notes again. Off in the distance, we hear
a bell ring. Charlie finishes his melody, puts his sax in
its case, and moves out. Todd, Cameron, and Pitts exit too.
Knox stands there, alone, looking at his poem, then exits
determinedly.
KNOX
Damn! Goddam! If it worked for
him, it'll work for me.
EXT. THE WELTON GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING
The dawn rises over the frozen Welton campus. Snow covers
the ground. The school bagpiper stands, playing a haunting
melody.
EXT. THE JUNIOR DORMITORY - SAME
Knox comes out of the dorm building, bundled against the
freezing weather. Be hurries onto his bike and speeds away.
EXT. RIDGEWAY HIGH SCHOOL
A large sign proclaims Ridgeway High School. Knox bikes up
to the school at full speed. He now carries a bouquet of
flowers. Out of breath, he quickly discards the bike and
runs into the school.

INT. THE HALLWAYS OF RIDGEWAY HIGH - MORNING
Students of both sexes move through the hallways of this
public school. Students are at their lockers, putting up
their coats and getting out their books. Knox runs through,
erratically looking around. He hurries down one hallway,
stops and asks a student something, then runs up a flight of
stairs.
I(cid:13) NT. ANOTHER RIDGEWAY HIGH HALLWAY - SAME
Chris stands in front of her locker, chatting with a couple
of girlfriends, taking out some books. Knox spots her and
approaches.
KNOX
Chris!
CHRIS
Knox! What are you doing here?
She pulls Knox away from her girlfriends.
KNOX
I came to apologize for the other
night. I brought you these and a
poem I wrote.
He holds out the flowers and the poem. Chris sees them, but
doesn't take them.
CHRIS
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you,
don't you know that?
KNOX
I don't care. I love you, Chris.
You deserve better than Chet and
I'm it. Please accept these.
CHRIS
Knox, you're crazy.
A bell rings. People clear the halls.
KNOX
Please. I acted like a jerk and I
know it. Please?
She looks at the flowers as if she's thinking about accepting
them.

CHRIS
No! And stop bugging me.
She walks into the classroom and closes the door. The
hallway clears. Knox stands holding his flowers and his
poem. There is a moment's hesitation, then he opens the door
and walks into the classroom.
INT. CHRIS' CLASSROOM - SAME
Class hasn't started but students are taking their seats. The
teacher leans over a student's desk, helping her with her
homework. Knox enters and walks to Chris' desk.
CHRIS
Knox, I don't believe this!
KNOX
All I'm asking you to do is listen.
(he opens his poem and
reads)
"The heavens made a girl named Chris,
With hair and skin of gold
To touch her would be paradise
To kiss her glory untold."
Chris turns red with embarrassment. Her friends restrain
giggles. Knox continues reading.
KNOX
"They made a goddess and called her Chris,
How? I'll never know.
But though my soul is far behind,
(cid:13) My love can only grow."
The rest of the class has now seen what is happening and all
eyes are on Knox. Chris covers her face but Knox continues.
KNOX
"I see a sweetness in her smile,
Bright light shines from her eyes,
But life is complete -- contentment
is mine, just knowing that she's
alive."
Knox lowers the poem. Chris looks up at him, utterly
embarrassed. Knox puts the poem and the flowers on her desk.
KNOX
I love you, Chris.
He turns and leaves.

INT. KEATING'S ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY
The boys sit. Keating hasn't arrived. Momentarily, Knox
enters and hurries to his desk.
CHARLIE
How'd it go? Did you read it to
her?
KNOX
Yep.
PITTS
All right! What'd she say?
KNOX
I don't know.
CHARLIE
What do you mean you don't know?
KNOX
I'll tell you later.
The door to the room opens. In walks Keating, wearing his
usual scarf and jacket. He puts his books on his desk, then
looks out over the class.
KEATING
Neil, could I see you a moment.
He walks into the hallway.
INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM - SAME
The corridor is empty except for Neil and Keating. Keating
closes the door to the classroom.
KEATING
What did your father say? Did you
talk to him?
NEIL
(lying)
Yeah.
KEATING
Really? You told your father what
you told me? You let him see your
passion for acting?

NEIL
Yeah. He didn't like it one bit
but at least he's letting me stay
in the play. Of course, he won't
be able to come. He'll be in
Chicago on business. But I think
he's gonna let me stay with acting.
As long as I keep my grades up.
N(cid:13) eil heads back into the classroom. Keating watches.
INT. THE DORM PHONE ROOM/STAIRWELL - NIGHT
Todd, Knox, Cameron, Pitts, and Meeks all wear coats and
ties. They mill in the dorm lobby. Knox is off to himself,
still looking morose.
MEEKS
Where's Nuwanda? We're gonna miss
Neil's entrance.
PITTS
He said something about getting red
before he left.
CAMERON
What the hell does that mean?
PITTS
You know Charlie.
Charlie scampers down the stairs.
MEEKS
What's this getting red?
Charlie checks around, then opens his shirt, revealing that
he has painted a red lightning bolt on his chest.
TODD
What's it for?
CHARLIE
It's an Indian warrior symbol for
virility. Makes me feel potent.
Like I can drive girls crazy.
PITTS
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
CHARLIE
(winks)
So much the better.

The others shoot each other looks, confirming their mutual
suspicion that Charlie has finally lost his marbles. As they
head out of the lobby, they pass Chris who is entering.
KNOX
Chris!
CHRIS
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
KNOX
(looking around)
You can't be in here.
He leads her out of the dorm.
EXT. THE DORM BUILDING - NIGHT
It is snowing. Knox ushers Chris out of the building and
down the sidewalk away from the others.
KNOX
If they catch you here, we'll both
be in big trouble.
CHRIS
Oh, but it's fine for you to come
barging into my school and make a
complete fool out of me?
KNOX
I didn't mean to make a fool of
you.
CHRIS
Well, you did! Chet found out and
he's nuts. It took everything I
could do to keep him from coming
here and killing you. You have to
stop this stuff, Knox.
(cid:13) KNOX
But I love you.
CHRIS
You say that over and over but you
don't even know me!
At the dorm, the others are waiting. Knox waves them on.
KNOX
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

The others walk on. Knox waits for them to disappear.
KNOX
Of course I know you! From the
first time I saw you, I knew you
had a wonderful soul.
CHRIS
Just like that?! You just knew?
KNOX
Of course just like that. That's
how you always know when it's
right.
CHRIS
And if it so happens that you're
wrong? If it just so happens that
I could care less about you?
KNOX
Then you wouldn't be here warning
me about Chet.
This gives Chris pause.
CHRIS
Look, I've got to go. I'm gonna be
late for the play.
KNOX
Are you going with Chet?
CHRIS
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
KNOX
Then come with me.
CHRIS
Knox, you are so infuriating!
KNOX
Just give me one chance. If you
don't like me after tonight, I'll
stay away forever.
CHRIS
Uh-huh.

KNOX
I promise. Dead Poets honor. Come
with me tonight, then if you don't
want to see me again, I swear I'll
bow out.
CHRIS
God, if Chet found out he'd...
KNOX
Chet won't know anything. We'll
sit in back and sneak away as soon
as it's over.
CHRIS
Knox, if you promise that this will
be the end of it...
KNOX
Dead Poets honor.
CHRIS
What is that?
KNOX
My word.
He crosses his heart with his fingers and looks sincere. He
leads a reluctant Chris off.
CHRIS
I must be losing my mind.
INT. HENSLEY HALL AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT
The auditorium is filled to near capacity with families,
teachers and students. Charlie, Todd, Meeks, Cameron, and
Pitts find seats in the back. They spot Mr. Keating a few
rows over and wave at him. Beside him is Mr. McAllister.
The lights go down. A small musical accompaniment --
panpipes, bongos, triangle -- plays. The curtain rises. As
the actors make their entrances, they are applauded by their
friends and families.
As the actors begin the play, Charlie notices out of the
corner of his eye Knox entering with Chris. They find seats
and sit down together. Charlie shoots Knox a surprised lock
o(cid:13) f excitement. Knox gives a little nod.

THE STAGE
Neil makes his entrance as Puck, he wears a crown of flowers.
The members of the Dead Poets Society cheer loudly. For a
moment Neil looks lost. Todd crosses his fingers.
NEIL (AS PUCK)
"Flow now, spirit. Wither wander
you?"
HIGH SCHOOL ACTOR (AS FAIRY)
"Over hill, over dale, through
bush, through brier..."
Keating glances back at the Dead Poets and gives them the
thumbs up for luck for Neil. They acknowledge with gestures
of their own.
NEIL (AS PUCK)
"Thou speakest aright: I am that
merry wanderer of the night. I jest
to Oberon and make him smile when I
a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly
foal..."
ANGLE ON THE "DEAD POETS"
intently watching the show. As Neil delivers his lines,
getting laughs in the right places, Todd sits mouthing the
lines with him, as if this might help Neil get through it.
Neil clearly needs no help, though, and his performance is
quite winning. Charlie leans to the others.
CHARLIE
(excited whisper)
He's good! He's goddamned good!
Someone from behind whispers '"Sssh." Charlie whispers
"sssh" back at them, then turns back and watches the show.
Suddenly he does a double-take. He sees: Mr. Perry enters in
the rear of the auditorium, and stands alone beside the door.
CHARLIE
Oh my God.
TODD
What?
Charlie indicates for the others to lock. Todd and the
others glance back and see Mr. Perry.

All turn back and watch the play, though they are now quite

THE PLAY
On stage are the characters of Lysander and Hermia. Hermia
is played by Ginny Danburry, who is fetching1y dressed in a
c(cid:13) ostume of leaves and twigs.
LYSANDER
"One turf shall serve as pillow for
us both, One heart, one bed, two
bosoms, and one troth."
GINNY (AS HERMIA)
"Nay good Lysander. For my sake,
my dear, Lie further off yet: do
not lie so near."
ANGLE ON THE DEAD POETS
Charlie is looking through the program.
CHARLIE
Hermia's Ginny Danburry. Knox is
crazy. She's beautiful!
Meeks holds his finger to his lips for Charlie to be quiet.
THE STAGE
GINNY (AS HERMIA)
"But gentle friend, for love and
courtesy Lie further off, in human
modesty. Such separation as may
well be said Becomes a virtuous
bachelor and a maid, So far be
distant: and goodnight, sweet
friend. Thy love ne'er alter till
they sweet life end."
Charlie sits absolutely enraptured by her.

Neil is hurriedly changing from his Puck costume into Puck's
"Robin" disguise. Neil's father approaches.

Neil. Get over here!
Neil is shocked to see his father.
NEIL
Father!
DR. PERRY
(furious - moving at Neil)
I gave you orders and you
deliberately disobeyed me!
Dr. Perry grabs Neil by the arm.
NEIL
(pulling away)
Father, I had to do it. Please,
Father, I have to be on stage.
DR. PERRY
You will not go back on stage!
Neil steps towards the stage, trying to wrench away from his
father's grip. He inadvertently pulls his father onto the
stage with him.
ANGLE ON THE STAGE
The audience stirs. Some laugh, thinking this is part of the
play. Dr. Perry is furious.
DR. PERRY
You will do as I say!
NEIL
I'm sick of doing what you say!
Neil still tries to pull away. Dr. Perry, blood red with
anger and embarrassment, slaps the struggling Neil across the
face. The audience gasps. Many stand as if to do something.
Dr. Perry drags the humiliated, protesting neil off the
s(cid:13) tage.
EXT. THE AUDITORIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Dr. Perry exits the auditorium holding the struggling,
protesting Neil.

Dr. Perry, give Neil a chance to
explain. He...
Dr. Perry shoves Keating away.
DR. PERRY
Don't you dare tell me how to raise
my son!
Dr. Perry puts Neil in the car them gets in. Charlie starts
to move at the car. Keating grabs him.
KEATING
Don't make it worse than it already
is.
Dr. Perry starts his car and pulls away. Neil looks
imploringly back at his friends as the car drives off.
TODD

He strikes the wall again. Keating enters, Jessica at his
side. He looks at the faces of the boys.
KEATING
Let us have a moment of silence in
support of fellow pledge Perry.
The boys and Keating stand in silence. Momentarily Keating
looks at the boys.
KEATING
All right, we mustn't be glum.
Neil wouldn't want it that way.
Let us join with the howling night.
K(cid:13) eating walks off. The others follow. Chris looks at Knox.
CHRIS
Knox, what is going on here?
KNOX
You'll see.
CHRIS
I have to go home.
KNOX
It's just for a little while. You
promised.
Chris reluctantly follows Knox.
EXT. THE CAMPUS OF WELTON - NIGHT
The moon is full, the stars are out, the night is clear and
cold. Every tree is covered with icicles. A freeze has
turned the otherwise barren forest into a wintertime marvel.
Mother Nature has covered the world with sparkling diamonds.
Keating leads the boys up a wooded path to a cliff
overlooking the creek. The boys quickly gather sticks and a
fire is built.

Come on boys, don't be shy.
Keating produces a pocket knife and quickly whittles a stick
into a skewer. From a small brown paper bag he produces
pieces of raw food.
TODD
I have something.
Todd's volunteering surprises everyone. Todd steps forward
and takes some papers from his pocket. He passes slips of
paper to each of the others.
TODD
Everybody read this between verses.
Todd opens his poem and reads.
TODD
"We are dreaming of tomorrow and tomorrow
isn't coming,
We are dreaming of a glory that we
don't really want.
We are dreaming of a new day when the new day's
here already
We are running from the battle when it's one
that must be fought."
Todd nods. All read.
ALL
"And still we sleep."
TODD
"We are listening for the calling but
never really heeding,
Hoping for the future when the future's
only plans.
Dreaming of the wisdom that we are
(cid:13) dodging daily,
Praying for a savior when salvation's
in our hands."

And still we sleep."
Todd closes his poem. There is a big applause.
KEATING
Bravo, Mr. Anderson. Wonderful!
Todd nods, taking this all in. As he steps down he gets
congratulatory slaps on the back. Keating begins putting the
raw meat onto the skewer.
PITTS
What's that stuff, Mr. Keating?
KEATING
Food for thought, my boy.
He lays the skewer on the fire. Flames flare around the
sizzling meat.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE PERRY HOME - INT. DR. PERRY'S CAR - NIGHT
Dr. Perry and Neil pull into the driveway in silence. Dr.
Perry turns the engine off. He turns to Neil.
DR. PERRY
Son, I am trying very hard to
understand why you insist on
defying me. Whatever the reason, I
am not going to let you ruin your
life. Tomorrow I am withdrawing
you from Welton and enrolling you
in Norfolk Military School.
Tear well fresh in Neil's already bloodshot eyes.
NEIL
No, Father. Please...
DR. PERRY
You have opportunities I never had,
Neil. I won't, let you squander

EXT. THE CLIFF ABOVE THE CREEK - NIGHT
Keating takes the skewer off the fire.
KEATING
Food, people.
He hands pieces of the food to the boys.
KEATING
For Mr. Dalton, marrow.
Charlie looks at the piece in front of him.
CHARLIE
(slightly disgusted)
Really?
KEATING
Absolutely, Charles.
All eyes are on Charlie. He takes the piece and eats
anticipating disgust. A slight smile crosses his face.
CHARLIE
Hey, not bad.
He holds the bone to his mouth and makes a loud sucking
sound. All laugh.
KEATING
For Mr. Meeks, brains.
More laughter. Meeks looks at the brains. He musters his
courage, then shovels them down and chews. The thought of
t(cid:13) hem clearly makes him a queasy but he keeps chewing.
KEATING
For Mr. Anderson... a tongue.
More laughter. Todd takes it in good humor and eats.
KEATING
For Mr. Overstreet and his friend,
a heart.
A chorus of mock sighs. All laugh. Chris looks in disgust
at the heart she and Knox are supposed to eat.
CHRIS

Knox eats some of the heart. Chris reluctantly does the
same. The others applaud.
KEATING
And for the rest of us, toes.
He hands toes to Jessica and Pitts.
KEATING
The toe should be nibbled, I
believe. Right Miss Jessica?
Jessica smiles then elbows Keating. Pitts tentatively
nibbles a toe.
KEATING
The world offers such variety,
people. We must rush at it with
our mouths open and partake of it
greedily.
He pops a toe into his mouth and,chews it with delight.
INT. A HALLWAY IN NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Down the hallway, in his bedroom, Dr. Perry is undressing. A
door to another room opens and Neil walks into the hall.
Unseen by his father, he turns a corner and moves off.
INT. DR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT
Moonlight illuminates the room. There are a few medical
plaques on the wall. The bookcases are full of medical
books. Neil enters.
Neil stands looking around the study then walks to his
father's desk. He sits for a moment looking at the objects
on the desk: prescription pad, a stethoscope, a miniature
gold plated heart that serves as a paper weight. Neil opens
the top drawer and reaches in the back. From this he pulls
out a key. With this key he unlocks the bottom drawer of the
desk. Sitting in this drawer is a revolver.
EXT. THE CLIFF ABOVE THE CREEK - NIGHT
Keating kicks dirt on the fire and stands.
KEATING
And now same words from the poet
Vachel Lindsay. When I pause, you
ask, "Are you washed in the blood

"Are you washed in the blood of the

Reciting loudly, Keating takes off trotting through the
woods. All trot off after him:
KEATING
"The Saints smiled gravely and they
said, 'He's come.'...
ALL
"Are you washed in the blood of the
Lamb?"
INT. DR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT
Neil checks the chamber of the revolver. The gun is loaded.
EXT. THE CLIFF ABOVE THE CREEK, NIGHT.
We see the group following Keating through the woods, past
icy trees, over snow covered hills, reciting Vachel Lindsay's
poem, "General William Booth Enters Into Heaven".
KEATING
"Walking-lepers followed rank on rank,
Lurching bravos from the ditches dank,
Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends pale-
Minds still passion ridden, soul-powers frail:
ALL
"Are you washed in the blood of the
Lamb?"
INT. DR.PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT
Neil puts the gun to his temple. He stares into nowhere.
EXT. ATOP A HILL - NIGHT
Keating stands before a towering, frozen waterfall. This
gorgeous, icy sculpture seems to defy the laws of gravity.
The night sky is incredibly clear. The people in the group
are lit by moonlight on the snow.
KEATING
"Christ came gently with a robe and crown,
For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down.
He saw King Jesus. They were face to face,
And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place.

INT. DR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT
Neil's finger slowly pulls the trigger of the gun. PAN away
from Neil's face to the snowy view out the study window. We
H(cid:13) EAR a GUNSHOT.
EXT. THE HILLTOP - SAME
Keating stops. He turns and looks at the fields, valley, and
at the magnificent sky that surrounds them. All are out of
breath, but exhilarated.
KEATING
We may or may not be the stuff of
eternity, people, but while we are
here we are part of a vast, awesome
magnificence.
He raises his hands to the heavens.
KEATING
Don't waste a second of it, people.
Exalt in it.
He holds his head back and shouts to the heavens.
KEATING
ALIVE!! ALIVE!!
The others do the same. Shouts go up, cries of joy and
ecstasy. Knox looks at Chris. Tears are streaming down both
of their faces. They turn to each other and kiss.
Passionately.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE CAMPUS - PRE-DAWN
Keating walks through the frozen snow with Jessica, Todd,
Charlie, Pitts and Meeks. Chris and Knox are close behind,
embracing and kissing. The majestic beauty of the snow
covered surroundings as the sun begins to rise is
breathtaking.
TODD
Oh Captain, my Captain?

TODD
Are you dying?
This takes Keating aback. The others too. But they await
Keating's answer.
KEATING
We're each of us dying, Mr.
Anderson. I am simply dying
faster. A rare trait, I'm told.
Inherited from my father.
Todd and the boys look at Keating. Many want to cry but none
do. Todd swallows hard.
TODD
Are you afraid?
KEATING
Every minute of every day. Though
to be honest, I think I'm more
afraid of being forgotten than of
dying. The dead are treated
frightfully, I think. They should
be planted alongside football
fields and golf courses, next to
swimming pools and movie theaters.
S(cid:13) o they won't be alone.
TODD
Why are you teaching; wny aren't
you writing?
KEATING
I no longer find joy working alone
in my room. I find it in teaching.
Perhaps teaching is what I should
have been doing all along.
TODD
Gosh, if it I were me, I'd want to
be out seeing the world or
something.
KEATING
Why Mr. Anderson, teaching is
seeing the world. The new world.
Seeing a student like you take
root, ready to flower and bloom any
day...

Tell it to my parents.
KEATING
Did it occur to you, Todd, that
your parents could be dead wrong
about you? How long have you been
away at school? How many years?
TODD
Since I was eight.
KEATING
Then how are they qualified to pass
judgment when they hardly know you!
They simply aren't looking.
TODD
But why?
KEATING
I don't know and you don't know but
whatever the reason, it's wrong!
You know that, Todd.
Keating grabs a round icicle off of a tree and holds it up to
the dawning sun.
KEATING
I hold in my hand a crystal ball.
In it I see great things for Todd
Anderson if he would only learn to
stand up for what he knows.
(lowers the icicle and
faces Todd)
Believe in yourself, Todd Anderson.
I do.
Todd looks at Keating. Tears well up in Todd's eyes.
Suddenly Todd hugs the man. Keating hugs him back then turns
to the others.
KEATING
Don't think I'm too ill do deliver
a whale of a final exam or to grade
you off severely if you confuse
Wordsworth with Whitman. That goes
for all of you. Now, go to bed.

He takes Jessica's hand and rushes off with her through the
snow. He makes a snowball and chases her off into the woods.
INT. TODD'S DORM - DAWN
Todd enters. The room is getting it's first dose of the
winter's morning light. Todd plops down on his bed and
covers himself with his blankets. He turns, glances at
N(cid:13) eil's empty bed, then closes his eyes.
INT. TODD'S DORM ROOM - MORNING
Todd sleeps in his bed. The door opens and in comes Charlie,
Knox, and Meeks. They look shaken. They look at each other,
then gently wake Todd.
CHARLIE
Todd. Todd...
Todd opens his eyes. He sits up, looking exhausted. His
eyes adjust to the light, then he closes them and lies back
down. He picks up his clock, squints at it.
TODD
Jesus, it's only eight. I gotta
sleep.
He lies back down for a moment, then opens his eyes again.
He sees the other boys, sitting there, staring at him. He
senses something wrong. He sits up.
CHARLIE
Todd, Neil's dead. He shot
himself.
Todd looks at Charlie for a minute. The other faces confirm
what Charlie is saying.
TODD
Oh my God...
He starts to vomit. As he does, he runs out of the room.
The other boys look at each other. Suddenly, Charlie breaks
into tears. He covers his face with his hands.
INT. THE DORM BATHROOM - DAY
Todd is moving back and forth, tears streaming down his face.
He hits the walls with his hand.

himself! He loved living!
KNOX
You don't seriously think his
father...
TODD
Not with the gun! Damn it, even if
the bastard didn't pull the trigger
he....
Todd sobs. Finally he controls himself.
TODD
Even if Dr. Perry didn't shoot him,
he killed him. They have to know
that!
He runs across the room.
TODD
NEIL! NEIL!!!
He falls against the wall, sobbing uncontrollably.
INT. THE HONOR ROOM - LATER
The entire Junior class is assembled. Standing along the
w(cid:13) alls are the teachers, Keating included. Nolan enters.
NOLAN
Gentlemen, the death of Neil Perry
is a tragedy. He was a fine
student one of Welton's best and he
will be missed. We have contacted
each of your explain the
situation. Naturally, all are
quite concerned. At the request of
Neil's family, I intend to conduct
a thorough inquiry into this
matter. Your complete cooperation
is expected.
INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
The room is dark. Todd, Knox, Charlie, Meeks and Pitts
enter. Keating stands solemnly in front of his desk. On the
blackboard behind him is written the following:
"On the Day of Judgement, Man will judge God."

Life is not fair that we should

(pause)
I fully expected to be the first
lull fledged member of the Dead
Poets Society. It is with great
sadness that instead we must induct
Neil Perry. Do not go gentle into
that good night, Neil Perry. Rage,
rage against the dying of the
light.
There is a long silence as Keating stands motionless.
Suddenly Keating yells:
KEATING
RAGE!!
INT. DORM BATHROOM - DAY
Charlie, Todd, Knox, and Pitts stand waiting. There is a
knock on the door then Meeks enters.
MEEKS
I can't find him.
CHARLIE
You told him about this meeting?
MEEKS
Twice.
CHARLIE
Oh shit...
Charlie goes to the window and looks out across the lawn. In
the distance is the administration building.
CHARLIE
That's it guys, we're all fried.
PITTS
You don't know that. Maybe he...
CHARLIE
Cameron's a-fink! Why else wasn't
he at the last meetings? He's in
Nolan's office, right now, finking!

To save himself.
Down the hall there is the sound of a door opening. Knox goes
to the door and looks out. He sees:
Cameron opening the door to his room.
KNOX
(loud whisper)
Cameron... Cameron...
Cameron looks at Knox. Cameron looks away and goes into his
r(cid:13) oom.
Knox turns back to the others. He is stunned.
KNOX
You're right.
INT. CAMERON AND CHARLIE'S DORM ROOM - DAY
Cameron is at the window, looking out. The door blasts open.
There stands Charlie, the others crowding behind him.
CHARLIE
You finked, didn't you Cameron?
CAMERON
I don't know what you mean.
CHARLIE
You were the one who had Nolan
search my room, and you just told
Nolan everything about the club.
.CAMERON
In case you hadn't heard, Dalton,
there's something called an Honor
Code at this school. If a teacher
asks you something, you tell the
truth or you're expelled.
Charlie moves at Cameron.
CHARLIE
Why you...
Meeks and Knox restrain Charlie.

KNOX
Don't touch him, Charlie. You do
and you're out!
CHARLIE
I'm out anyway!
KNOX
You don't know that. Not yet!
CAMERON
He's right there, Charlie. And if
you're smart, every one of you will
do exactly what I did and
cooperate. They're not after us.
We're the victims. Us and Neil.
CHARLIE
What does that mean? Who are they
after?
CAMERON
Why Mr. Keating, of course. The
"Captain" himself. You didn't
really think he could avoid
responsibility, did you?
CHARLIE
Mr. Keating? Responsible for Neil?
Is that what they're saying?!
He pulls himself free of Meeks and Knox's grips.
CAMERON
Who else do you think, you dumb
ass? The administration? Dr.
Perry? Keating put us up to all
this crap, didn't he? If it wasn't
for him Neil would be cosied up in
his room right now, studying his
chemistry and dreaming of being
called doctor.
TODD
That's not true! Mr. Keating
didn't tell Neil what to do. Neil
loved acting.

Charlie bolts across the room and strikes Cameron across the
face. Cameron falls to the floor. Charlie stands over him.
KNOX
Charlie!
CAMERON
(at Charlie)
You just signed your expulsion
papers, "Nuwanda".
Cameron grabs a towel and holds it to his bleeding nose.
Charlie turns and walks out. The others walk out too.
CAMERON
(shouting after them)
If the rest of you guys are smart
you'll do exactly what I did! They
know everything anyway. You can't
save Keating but you can save
yourselves!
INT. TODD'S DORM ROOM - DAY
Neil's bed is stripped and his desk is empty. Todd sits at
his window, looking across the campus at the administration
building. Momentarily Meeks is escorted out by Dr. Sager.
S(cid:13) ager escorts Meeks across campus, back to the dorm.
INT. THE DORM HALLWAY - SAME
Todd peers out of the door of his room. Meeks and Sager
enter the hallway. Sager stops at the end of the hall.
Meeks walks silently back to his room. As he passes Todd, he
doesn't look at him. But tears stream down Meeks' face.
Meeks enters his room and shuts the door.
SAGER
Knox Overstreet.
Knox comes out of his room and joins Sager at the end of the
hall. The pair exit together. Momentarily, Todd walks across
the hall to Meeks's room. Todd knocks.

Todd pauses, realizing what has happened.
TODD
What happened to Charlie?
MEEKS (O.S.)
Expelled.
Todd stands stunned.
TODD
What'd you tell them?
MEEKS (O.S.)
Nothing they didn't already know.
Todd turns away.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. TODD'S ROOM - LATER
Todd watches as Knox is escorted across campus and back to
the dorm by Dr. Sager. Again Todd peers into the hall.
INT. THE DORM HALLWAY - SAME
Knox and Sager enter. Knox's chin is quivering. He is on
the verge of a breakdown. He goes into his room and shuts
the door.
Todd steps back into his room and leans against the wall.
The fact that Knox has been broken clearly shakes him up. He
breathes hard and looks up at the ceiling.
DR. SAGER (O.S.)
Todd Anderson.
INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Headmaster Nolan sits at his desk. On one side of the room
is Dr. Perry. On the other side are Todd's parents
(recognizable from the picture on Todd's desk). Todd enters
with Dr. Sager. Todd sees Dr Perry, then his parents.

MRS. ANDERSON
I have never been so disappointed
in my life.
MR. ANDERSON
How could you do this after all
we've done for you?
Todd's lip quivers. Nolan looks at Todd.
NOLAN
Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.
There is an empty chair - like the prisoner's chair at an
inquisition - in front of Nolan's desk. Todd sits. He looks
at his parents who are still steely eyed. Perspiration
breaks out all across Todd's brow.
NOLAN
Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty
well put together what's happened
here. You do admit to being a part
of this Dead Poets Society?
Todd looks at his parents and Nolan. He closes his eyes. He
starts to nod yes. Before he can, his father speaks.
MR. ANDERSON
Answer him.
TODD
(almost stuttering)
Yes... sir. Yes. Yes sir.
NOLAN
The regular members besides Neil
were Knox Overstreet, Charles
Dalton, Steven Meeks, Richard
Cameron, Gerrard Pitts and you who
acted as secretary. Any others?
TODD
(softly looking at his
parents, pleading with
his eyes)
No... No sir.

NOLAN
I can't hear you, Todd.
TODD
(not much louder than
before)
No sir. No sir.
Nolan looks at Todd then at the boy's parents. Nolan decides
not to press the issue of Todd's inaudibility. Nolan holds
up a piece of paper.
NOLAN
I have here a detailed description
of what went on at your meetings.
It describes how your teacher, Mr.
Keating, encouraged you boys to
organize the club and to use it as
a source of inspiration for
reckless, self indulgent behavior.
It describes how Mr. Keating's
behavior, both in and out of the
classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to
follow this obsession of acting
when Mr. Keating knew it went
directly against the explicit
orders of Neil's family. It is Mr.
Keating's blatant abuse of his
position as a teacher that led
directly to Neil Perry's death.
Nolan hands the paper to Todd.
NOLAN
Read this carefully, Todd. If you
have nothing to add or amend, then
sign it.
Todd takes this paper and reads it. He spends a long time
doing so and by the time he finishes his hands and the paper
are shaking. Todd looks up.
TODD
(to Nolan with great
difficulty speaking)
What... what is going to happen...
to Mr. Keating?
MRS. ANDERSON

NOLAN
(to Mrs. Anderson)
That's all right. I want him to
know.
(to Todd)
We are not yet clear as to whether
Mr. Keating has broken any laws.
If he has he will be prosecuted.
What we can do - and yours and the
others' signatures will help to
guarantee it - is see to it that
Mr. Keating will never teach again.
TODD
(tears flowing down his
face)
Never... teach...
Todd's father stands and moves toward Todd.
MR. ANDERSON
I've had enough. Sign the paper,
Todd.
TODD
But... teaching is all he has... It
means everything to him.
MR. ANDERSON
What do you care?
TODD
(cold)
What do you care about me? He
cares about me. You don't.
Todd's father stands over him and picks up the pen.
MR. ANDERSON
Sign the paper, Todd.
Todd shakes his head no.
TODD
I won't sign it.
MR. ANDERSON
Todd!
TODD
It's not true! I won't sign it.

Todd's father grabs the pen and tries to put it back in
Todd's hand. Nolan stands.
NOLAN
That's all right! We don't need his
signature. Let him suffer the
(cid:13) consequences.
Nolan walks around his desk to Todd.
NOLAN
You think you can save Mr. Keating?
You saw it, boy, we have the
signatures of all the others. But,
if you don't sign, you're on
disciplinary probation for the rest
of the year. You'll do work duty
every afternoon and every Saturday.
And, if you set foot off campus,
you'll be expelled.
Todd's parents and Mr. Nolan watch Todd, waiting for him to
change his mind. Todd thinks, then:
TODD
I won't sign.
NOLAN
Then I'll see you back here after
classes. You may go.
Todd stands and exits. Nolan looks at Todd's parents.
NOLAN
Don't worry. We'll bring him
around.
INT. THE ENGLISH CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON
Todd, Knox, Meek, Pitts, Cameron and the rest of the class
are there. Conspicuously empty are Neil's desk and Charlie's
desk. Todd looks numb, his gaze downward, reminding us of
the way he looked when we first met him. Knox, Meeks, and
Pitts look humiliated. All of the former club members are
too ashamed of themselves to look at one another. Only
Cameron looks halfway normal. He sits at his desk studying
as though nothing had happened.
The door opens. In strides Mr. Nolan. All stand. Nolan
sits at the teacher's desk. All sit down.

Since the semester is so near to a

class through exams. We will find
a permanent English teacher during
the Christmas holidays. Who would
like to tell me where you are in
the Hutton textbook?
Nolan looks around. There are no volunteers.
NOLAN
Mr. Anderson?
TODD
(softly, barely audible)
(cid:13) The... Hutton...
Todd looks through his books. He fumbles nervously.
NOLAN
I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.
TODD
(still low)
I... think we...
NOLAN
(exasperated with this)
Mr. Cameron, kindly inform me.
CAMERON
We skipped around a lot, sir. We
covered the romantics and most of
the chapters on post civil war
literature.
NOLAN
What about the realists?
CAMERON
I believe we skipped most of that.
Nolan flips through the text. The door to the classroom
opens. Mr. Keating enters.

Gentlemen, turn to page fifty four.
Mr. Cameron, read aloud the poem by
Eugene Field.
CAMERON
Mr. Nolan, that page has been
ripped out.
NOLAN
Then borrow somebody else's book.
CAMERON
They're all ripped out, sir.
NOLAN
(staring at Keating)
What do you mean they're all ripped
out?
CAMERON
Sir we...
NOLAN
Never mind, Cameron.
He carries his textbook to Cameron's desk.
NOLAN
Here. Read.

But sturdy and stanch he stands.
And the little toy soldier is red with rust,
And his musket moulds in his hands...
As Cameron continues reading, Keating, who is at the closet
in the front corner of the room, looks out at the students.
He sees Todd, whose eyes are full of tears. He sees Knox,
Meeks, Pitts, too shamed to look him in the eye but
nevertheless full of emotion. The irony of Nolan choosing
the "Little Blue Boy" is too incredible.
Keating finishes his packing. He walks across the room
towards the door. Just as Keating reaches the door, Todd can
no longer hold it in.

TODD
(interrupting Cameron's
reading)
Mr. Keating, they made them sign
it!
KEATING
I know that, Todd.
NOLAN
Quiet, Mr. Anderson! Leave, Mr.
Keating!
TODD
But it wasn't his fault, Mr. Nolan!
Neil's father did it. Neil wanted
to be an actor more than anything.
Nolan strides down the aisle and slaps Todd mightily. The
boy falls to the floor.
NOLAN
One more outburst, Mr. Anderson!
(turns to the class)
Or anyone else! And you are out of
this school!
He turns toward Keating who has taken a few steps back
towards Todd as though to help.
NOLAN
Leave now.
Keating stands facing Nolan. He turns and faces the class.
KEATING
Wonderful things are possible if we
only dare dream them, boys. Be
bold.
NOLAN
GET OUT!
The boys stare at Keating. He stares at them, taking them in
for the last time. Keating turns and moves towards the door.
TODD
Oh Captain!
Keating turns. So does everybody else. Todd pulls himself
off the floor, props one foot up on his desk then stands up
on it. He stands atop his desk, holding back tears, facing
Mr. Keating.

NOLAN
(moving at him)
You little...
As Nolan moves down the aisle, Knox (whose seat is on the
other side of the room) calls Mr. Keating's name and stands
up on his desk too. Nolan turns and sees this. Meeks
musters his courage and stands on his desk. Pitts does the
same. One by one and then in groups, the rest of the class
follows suit. Soon the entire class is standing on their
desks in silent salute to Mr. Keating.
Nolan who started at Todd, then at Overstreet, stands
motionless. He is amazed by this overwhelming response.
Keating stands at the door, tears welling in his eyes.
KEATING
Thank you, boys.
Keating looks into Todd's eyes, then into all their eyes,
gives a nod, then exits.
ANGLE ON each of the members of the Dead Poets Society
standing on their desks:
MEEKS
PITTS
KNOX
and finally, TODD, who is holding back tears but standing
proud.
BLACKOUT.
